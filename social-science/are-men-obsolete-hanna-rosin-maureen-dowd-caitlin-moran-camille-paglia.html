  <title>Are Men Obsolete? - Hanna Rosin, Maureen Dowd, Caitlin Moran, Camille Paglia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time in history, will it be better to be a woman than a man in the upcoming century? The twelfth semi-annual Munk Debate pits Hanna Rosin and Maureen Dowd against Caitlin Moran and Camille Paglia to debate one of the biggest socio-economic phenomena of our time &amp;#8212; the relative decline of the power and status of men in the workplace, in the family, and society at large.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men have traditionally been the dominant sex. But now, for the first time, a host of indicators suggests that women not only are achieving equality with men, but are fast emerging as the more successful sex of the species. Whether in education, employment, personal health, or child rearing, statistics point to a rise in the status and power of women at home, in the workplace, and in traditional male bastions such as politics. But are men, and the age-old power structures associated with &amp;#8220;maleness,&amp;#8221; permanently in decline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this edition of the Munk Debates &amp;#8212; Canada&amp;#8217;s premier debate series &amp;#8212; renowned author and editor Hanna Rosin and Pulitzer Prize&amp;#8211;winning columnist Maureen Dowd square off against &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8211;bestselling author Caitlin Moran and academic trailblazer Camille Paglia to debate the future of men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With women increasingly demonstrating their ability to &amp;#8220;have it all&amp;#8221; while men lag behind, the Munk Debate on gender tackles the essential socio-economic question: Are men obsolete?&lt;/p&gt;" />
