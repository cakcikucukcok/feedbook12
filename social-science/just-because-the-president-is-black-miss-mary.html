  <title>Just Because the President Is Black - Miss Mary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sole purpose of writing this book is to shake Americans out of their stupor and into the greatness they keep swearing this country is all about. Americans are 100% responsible for where we are now and where we will be in the future. The power is in our hands but not as long as we allow ourselves to stay divided. President Obama is not the sole reason for our division but because of racism, he is a major factor. This is a book explaining the manipulation of the public. The American public keeps allowing the wealthy minority to divide them making them co-conspirators in their own demise. The election of this black President makes Americans easy pickings. Hopefully, at the end of this book, America will finally be motivated to recognize and get past their subconscious racism, which makes us especially vulnerable to any type of divisive manipulation. Hopefully, we can stop dividing and unify for our own good." />
