  <title>The City Is the Factory - Miriam Greenberg, Penny Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Urban public spaces, from the streets and squares of Buenos Aires to Zuccotti Park in New York City, have become the emblematic sites of contentious politics in the twenty-first century. As the contributors to &lt;em&gt;The City Is the Factory &lt;/em&gt;argue, this resurgent politics of the square is itself part of a broader shift in the primary locations and targets of popular protest from the workplace to the city. This shift is due to an array of intersecting developments: the concentration of people, profit, and social inequality in growing urban areas; the attacks on and precarity faced by unions and workers&#39; movements; and the sense of possibility and actual leverage afforded by local politics and the tactical use of urban space. Thus, &quot;the city&quot;—from the town square to the banlieu—is becoming like the factory of old: a site of production and profit-making as well as new forms of solidarity, resistance, and social reimagining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see examples of the city as factory in new place-based political alliances, as workers and the unemployed find common cause with &quot;right to the city&quot; struggles. Demands for jobs with justice are linked with demands for the urban commons—from affordable housing to a healthy environment, from immigrant rights to “urban citizenship” and the right to streets free from both violence and racially biased policing. The case studies and essays in &lt;em&gt;The City Is the Factory&lt;/em&gt; provide descriptions and analysis of the form, substance, limits, and possibilities of these timely struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors&lt;br /&gt;
