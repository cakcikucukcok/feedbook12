      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Learn how Trump is making America great again -- and why government and media elites attack his vision -- in this &quot;inspiring and informative&quot; book from one of his key political advisors (Sean Hannity).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt; p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Geneva} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-indent: 36.0px; font: 12.0px Geneva} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Geneva; min-height: 16.0px} p.p4 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: center; font: 12.0px Geneva; min-height: 16.0px} &lt;/style&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Donald Trump is unlike any president we&#39;ve ever had.

Trump has enacted policies and set goals that send our country in a bold new direction -- one that is &quot;unreasonable&quot; to Washington elites but sensible to millions of Americans outside the Beltway. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Understanding Trump&lt;/i&gt;, Newt Gingrich provides unique insight into how the president&#39;s past experiences have helped to shape his life and style of governing, including a thorough analysis of how President Trump thinks and makes decisions, as well as his philosophy, doctrine, and forward-thinking political agenda.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Discover Trump-style solutions for national security, education, health care, economic growth, government reform, and other important topics. In this eye-opening book, Gingrich also investigates and exposes the forces in the Washington establishment, media, and bureaucracy that oppose the president at every turn.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally, &lt;i&gt;Understanding Trump&lt;/i&gt; explains the president&#39;s actions so far and lays out a vision for what Americans can do to help make President Trump&#39;s agenda a success. With your help, President Trump will be able to overcome corrupt interests in Washington and fulfill his promise to make America great again.&lt;!--~b~--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
