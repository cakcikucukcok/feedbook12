  <title>Czech American Bibliography - Miloslav Rechcigl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a comprehensive bibliography of publications relating to Czechs in America, from the earliest time since the discovery of the New World to date, covering their settlement, community life and their contributions to their host country. Although emphasis is on English titles, including books, as well as articles, the relevant titles in Czech language have also been included, particularly in those areas where there is a paucity of English titles. English translations of the Czech titles were normally placed in parentheses. To assure maximum utility, the bibliography has been organized and classified into specific sectors by subject. Under most major headings, general surveys are listed first, followed by more specific categories, which have, in turn, been subdivided into subcategories. Individual entries in all sections are arranged chronologically. Under most subject areas separate biographical sections were added, comprising individuals of note in the respective fields. Apart from providing information on just about every aspect of human endeavor, it is hoped that it will induce serious students and scholars to do more work in areas that have not been adequately researched." />
