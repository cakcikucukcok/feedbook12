  <title>The Joy of Big Knickers - Kate Garraway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TV and radio presenter Kate Garraway has a lot on her mind. She&#39;s about to turn 50, which is fine (she thinks) but suddenly she seems to have MANY questions about EVERYTHING.
Is she running out of time? Should she have had children earlier? How will she cope when they leave home? What on Earth is happening to her body? Should she be bungee jumping, skydiving... and all of those other bucket list type things? Is cosmetic surgery the norm now? What will happen to her sex life after the menopause? Is her pension big enough? Her parents cared for? The height of her career (gulp) over? And why, oh, why do her knickers keep getting bigger?
In this revealing exploration of ageing, Kate tackles the biggest issues women in their supposed &#39;prime&#39; face and searches for answers on their behalf, by drawing on her own experiences and those of others, consulting experts and challenging herself more than she&#39;s ever done so before. Written with all of the natural warmth and humour she&#39;s known for, it&#39;s a candid look at what it really means to be a modern older woman and why each and every one should be celebrated... big knickers and all!" />
