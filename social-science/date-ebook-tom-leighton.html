      <meta name="description" content="Richard was on the rebound, they said. The love of his life had just died of AIDS. And he was skeptical that lightening could strike twice. But he wasn&#39;t ready to give up, despite his age: at least there was sex. And his friend Pieter in Amsterdam was sympathetic and provided a route out of his New York life, too full of old memories. And then lightening did strike twice. &quot;All the wrong places&quot; was where it happened or seemed to. And the guy? A young blond out of his dream book? It seemed insane. But love works in two directions, and René was more than a blond fantasy. He saw things differently. And his life, both of their lives, would change." />
