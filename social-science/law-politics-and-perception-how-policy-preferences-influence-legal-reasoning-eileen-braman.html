  <title>Law, Politics, and Perception: How Policy Preferences Influence Legal Reasoning - Eileen Braman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are judges&#39; decisions more likely to be based on personal inclinations or legal     authority? The answer, Eileen Braman argues, is both. Law, Politics, and Perception brings     cognitive psychology to bear on the question of the relative importance of norms of legal     reasoning versus decision markers&#39; policy preferences in legal decision-making. While Braman     acknowledges that decision makers&#39; attitudes-or, more precisely, their preference for policy     outcomes-can play a significant role in judicial decisions, she also believes that     decision-makers&#39; belief that they must abide by accepted rules of legal analysis significantly     limits the role of preferences in their judgements. To reconcile these competing factors, Braman     posits that judges engage in &quot;motivated reasoning,&quot; a biased process in which decision-makers     are unconsciously predisposed to find legal authority that is consistent with their own     preferences more convincing than those that go against them. But Braman also provides evidence     that the scope of motivated reasoning is limited. Objective case facts and accepted norms of     legal reasoning can often inhibit decision makers&#39; ability to reach conclusions consistent with     their preferences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
