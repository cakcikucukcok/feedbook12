  <title>John Foster Dulles: Piety, Pragmatism, and Power in U.S. Foreign Policy - Richard H. Immerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Foster Dulles was one of the most influential and controversial figures in the history of twentieth-century U.S. foreign relations. Active in the field for decades, Dulles reflected and was a reflection of the tension that pervaded U.S. international conduct from its evolution as a global power in the early twentieth century through its emergence as the &#39;leader of the Free World&#39; during the Cold War. His life and career embody the best and most troubling aspects of American foreign policy as it progressed toward international supremacy while swaying between altruism and self-interest.&lt;p&gt; In this biography, Richard Immerman traces Dulles&#39;s path from his early days growing up in the parsonage of the First Presbyterian Church of Watertown, N.Y., through his years of amassing influence and power as an international business lawyer and adviser, to his service as President Eisenhower&#39;s secretary of state.&lt;/p&gt; This volume illuminates not only the history of modern U.S. foreign policy, but its search for a twentieth-century identity. Sophisticated yet accessible, &lt;i&gt;John Foster Dulles: Piety, Pragmatism, and Power in U.S. Foreign Policy&lt;/i&gt; is an important resource for graduate and undergraduate courses in U.S. history and U.S. foreign relations." />
