  <title>The Master of Confessions - Thierry Cruvellier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Renowned journalist Thierry Cruvellier takes us into the dark heart of Cambodia&amp;#39;s Khmer Rouge with &lt;em&gt;The Master of Confessions&lt;/em&gt;, a suspenseful account of a Chief Interrogator&amp;#39;s trial for war crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 17, 1975, the communist Khmer Rouge, led by its secretive prime minister Pol Pot, took over Cambodia. Renaming the country Democratic Kampuchea, they cut the nation off from the world and began systematically killing and starving two million of their people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after their fall, a man named Duch (pronounced &amp;#34;Do&amp;#239;k&amp;#34;), who had served as Chief Prison officer of S21, the regime&amp;#39;s central prison complex, stood trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Unlike any other tribunal defendant, Duch acknowledged his personal responsibility, pleaded guilty, and asked for forgiveness from his victims. In &lt;em&gt;The Master of Confessions&lt;/em&gt;, Thierry Cruvellier uses the trial to tell the horrifying story of this terrible chapter in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruvellier offers a psychologically penetrating, devastating look at the victims, the torturers, and the regime itself, searching to answer crucial questions about culpability. Self-drawing on his knowledge, and experience, Cruvellier delivers a startling work of journalistic history&amp;#8212;by turns deeply moving, horrifying, and darkly funny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
