  <title>Harvard&#39;s Secret Court - William Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2002, a researcher for The Harvard Crimson came across a restricted archive labeled &quot;Secret Court Files, 1920.&quot; The mystery he uncovered involved a tragic scandal in which Harvard University secretly put a dozen students on trial for homosexuality and then systematically and persistently tried to ruin their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May of 1920, Cyril Wilcox, a freshman suspended from Harvard, was found sprawled dead on his bed, his room filled with gas--a suicide. The note he left behind revealed his secret life as part of a circle of (cut &quot;young&quot;) homosexual students.The resulting witch hunt and the lives it cost remains one of the most shameful episodes in the history of America&#39;s premiere university. Supported by legendary Harvard President Lawrence Lowell, Harvard conducted its investigation in secrecy. Several students committed suicide; others had their lives destroyed by an ongoing effort on the part of Harvard to destroy their reputations. Harvard&#39;s Secret Court is a deeply moving indictment of the human toll of intolerance and the horrors of injustice that can result when a powerful institution loses its balance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
