  <title>Sisters in the Struggle - Bettye Collier-Thomas, V.P. Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women were at the forefront of the civil rights struggle, but their indvidiual stories were rarely heard.  Only recently have historians begun to recognize the central role women played in the battle for racial equality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;B&gt;Sisters in the Struggle&lt;/B&gt;, we hear about the unsung heroes of the civil rights movements such as Ella Baker, who helped found the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, Fannie Lou Hamer, a sharecropper who took on segregation in the Democratic party (and won), and Septima Clark, who created a network of &quot;Citizenship Schools&quot; to teach poor Black men and women to read and write and help them to register to vote.  We learn of Black women&#39;s activism in the Black Panther Party where they fought the police, as well as the entrenched male leadership, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, where the behind-the-scenes work of women kept the organization afloat when it was under siege.  It also includes first-person testimonials from the women who made headlines with their courageous resistance to segregation&amp;#151;Rosa Parks, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and Dorothy Height.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This collection represents the coming of age of African-American women&#39;s history and presents new stories that point the way to future study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contributors: Bettye Collier-Thomas, Vicki Crawford, Cynthia Griggs Fleming, V. P. Franklin, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, Farah Jasmine Griffin, Duchess Harris, Sharon Harley, Dorothy I.
