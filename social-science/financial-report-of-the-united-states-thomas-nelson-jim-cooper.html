  <title>Financial Report of the United States - Thomas Nelson, Jim Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Think of the federal government as a gigantic insurance company (with a side line business in national defense and homeland security) which only does its accounting on a cash basis-only counting premiums and payouts as they go in and out the door.&amp;nbsp; An insurance company with cash accounting is not an insurance company at all.&amp;nbsp; It is an accident waiting to happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter R. Fisher, former Bush Administration Undersecretary of the Treasury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our objective in preparing the fiscal year 2005 Financial Report of the U.S. Government is to give Congress and the American people a timely and useful report on the cost of the Federal Government&#39;s operations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John W. Snow, former Bush Administration Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scoring the budget on an accrual basis-the private sector norm and, I believe, a sensible direction for federal budget accounting-would better underscore the tradeoffs we face.&amp;nbsp; Under accrual accounting, benefits would be counted as they are earned by workers rather than when they are paid out by the government.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The significance of these accrual-based reports is that they show the implications of current budgetary decisions over a longer time horizon&amp;hellip;. This information is therefore an important element of the debate about the real effects of governmental commitments.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul H. O&#39;Neill, former Bush Administration Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;[A] practical management tool for policy-makers and a source of useful information for the public about the assets, liabilities, and operations of the government.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lawrence H. Summers, former Clinton Administration Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We believe that the publication of this financial report is an important step in providing the American public with useful information about their government&#39;s assets, liabilities and operations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert E. Rubin, former Clinton Administration Secretary of the Treasury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2005, the White House published its &lt;em&gt;Financial Report of the United States Government&lt;/em&gt;-only 2000 copies were printed despite the purpose of the report being to explain the country&#39;s financial wellbeing to Congress and the American people. Now, for the first time, that report is widely published so the American people can see what&#39;s really going on with the nation&#39;s finances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
