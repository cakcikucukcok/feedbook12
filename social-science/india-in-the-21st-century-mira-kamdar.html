  <title>India in the 21st Century - Mira Kamdar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="India is fast overtaking China to become the most populous country on Earth. By mid-century, its 1.7 billion people will live in what is projected to become the world&#39;s second-largest economy after China. While a democracy and an open society compared to China, assertive Hindu nationalism is posing new challenges to India&#39;s democratic freedoms and institutions at a time when illiberal democracies and autocratic leaders are on the rise worldwide. How India&#39;s destiny plays out in the coming decades will matter deeply to a world where the West&#39;s influence in shaping the 21st century will decline as that of these two Asian giants and other emerging economies in Africa and Latin America rise. In &lt;em&gt;India in the 21st Century&lt;/em&gt;, Mira Kamdar, a former member of the New York Times Editorial Board and an award-winning author, offers readers an introduction to India today in all its complexity.
In a concise question-and-answer format, Kamdar addresses India&#39;s history, including its ancient civilization and kingdoms; its religious plurality; its colonial legacy and independence movement; the political and social structures in place today; its rapidly growing economy and financial system; India&#39;s place in the geopolitical landscape of the 21st century; the challenge to India posed by climate change and dwindling global resources; wealth concentration and stark social inequalities; the rise of big data and robotics; the role of social media and more. She explores India&#39;s contradictions and complications, while celebrating the merging of India&#39;s multicultural landscape and deep artistic and intellectual heritage with the Information Age and the expansion of mass media.
With clarity and balance, Kamdar brings her in-depth knowledge of India and eloquent writing style to bear in this focused and incisive addition to Oxford&#39;s highly successful What Everyone Needs to Know series." />
