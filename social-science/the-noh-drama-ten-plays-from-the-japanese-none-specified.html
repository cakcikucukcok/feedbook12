  <title>The Noh Drama: Ten Plays from the Japanese - None Specified</title>

In addition to his dramatic activities, Zeami composed a number of works, the most important of which is called the Kwadensho (the Book of the Flower), or more properly, Fushi-kwadensho which he explained the nature and aesthetic principles governing Noh plays, and gave detailed instructions concerning the manner of composition, acting, direction, and production of these dramas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Combining the elements of dance, miming, music, and chants, Noh plays may be described as lyrico-dramatic tone-poems, in which the text has a function somewhat similar to that of the libretto in a Wagner or Debussy opera.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
