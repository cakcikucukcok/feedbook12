  <title>Notes of a Racial Caste Baby - Bryan K. Fair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Constitution of the United States, writes Bryan Fair, was a series of compromises between white male propertyholders: Southern planters and Northern merchants. At the heart of their deals was a clear race-conscious intent to place the interests of whites above those of blacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this provocative and important book, Fair, the eighth of ten children born to a single mother on public assistance in an Ohio ghetto, combines two histories--America&#39;s and his own- -to offer a compelling defense of affirmative action. How can it be, Fair asks, that, after hundreds of years of racial apartheid during which whites were granted 100% quotas to almost all professions, we have now convinced ourselves that, after a few decades of remedial affirmative action, the playing field is now level? Centuries of racial caste, he argues, cannot be swept aside in a few short years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fair ambitiously surveys the most common arguments for and against affirmative action. He argues that we must distinguish between America in the pre-Civil Rights Movement era--when the law of the land was explicitly anti-black--and today&#39;s affirmative action policies--which are decidedly not anti- white.  He concludes that the only just and effective way in which to account for America&#39;s racial past and to negotiate current racial quagmires is to embrace a remedial affirmative action that relies neither on quotas nor fiery rhetoric, but one which takes race into account alongside other pertinent factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Championing the model of diversity on which the United States was purportedly founded, Fair serves up a personal and persuasive account of why race-conscious policies are the most effective way to end de facto segregation and eliminate racial caste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;        A Note to the Reader   &lt;BR&gt;        Acknowledgments     &lt;BR&gt;    Preface: Telling Stories     &lt;BR&gt;      Recasting Remedies as Diseases   &lt;BR&gt;       Color-Blind Justice    &lt;BR&gt;       The Design of This Book   &lt;BR&gt;       Pt. 1.
