  <title>Blackballed - Lawrence Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;College&quot; is a word that means many things to many people: a space for  knowledge, a place to gain lifelong friends, and an opportunity to  transcend one&#39;s socioeconomic station. Today, though, this word also  recalls a slew of headlines that have revealed a dark and persistent  world of racial politics on campus. Does this association disturb our  idealized visions of what happens behind the ivied walls of higher  learning?  It should-because campus racism on college campuses is as  American as college football on Fall Saturdays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Lawrence Ross, author of &lt;i&gt;The Divine Nine &lt;/i&gt;and the leading expert on sororities and fraternities, &lt;i&gt;Blackballed&lt;/i&gt;  is an explosive and controversial book that rips the veil off America&#39;s  hidden secret: America&#39;s colleges have fostered a racist environment  that makes them a hostile space for African American students. &lt;i&gt;Blackballed&lt;/i&gt;  exposes the white fraternity and sorority system, with traditions of  racist parties, songs, and assaults on black students; and the  universities themselves, who name campus buildings after racist men and  women. It also takes a deep dive into anti-affirmative action policies,  and how they effectively segregate predominately white universities,  providing ample room for white privilege. A bold mix of history and the  current climate, &lt;i&gt;Blackballed&lt;/i&gt; is a call to action for universities  to make radical changes to their policies and standards to foster a  better legacy for all students.&lt;/p&gt;" />
