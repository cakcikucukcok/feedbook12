  <title>Growing Up Chicana/o - Bill Adler, A Lopez, Tiffany A. Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What Does It Mean To Grow Up Chicana/o?&lt;/p&gt;When I was growing up, I never read anything in school by anyone who had a &quot;Z&quot; in their last name. This anthology is, in many ways, a public gift to that child who was always searching for herself whithin the pages of a book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from the Introduction by Tiffany Ana Lopez&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louie The Foot Gonzalez tells of an eighty-nine-year-old woman with only one tooth who did strange and magical healings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her name was Dona Tona and she was never taken seriously until someone got sick and sent for her. She&#39;d always show up, even if she had to drag herself, and she stayed as long as needed. Dona Tona didn&#39;t seem to mind that after she had helped them, they ridiculed her ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosa Elena Yzquierdo remembers when homemade tortillas and homespun wisdom went hand-in-hand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;As children we watched our &lt;/em&gt;abuelas &lt;em&gt;lovingly make tortillas. In my own grandmother&#39;s kitchen, it was an opportunity for me to ask questions within the safety of that warm room...and the conversation carried resonance far beyond the kitchen...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandra Cisneros remembers growing up in Chicago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teachers thought if you were poor and Mexican you didn&#39;t have anything to say. Now I know, &quot;We&#39;ve got to tell our own history...making communication happen between cultures.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
