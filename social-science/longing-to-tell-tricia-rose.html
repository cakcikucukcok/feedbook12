  <title>Longing to Tell - Tricia Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sexual Lives of Black Women, In Their Own Words&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a culture driven by sexual and racial imagery, very few honest conversations about race, gender, and sexuality actually take place. In their absence, commonly held perceptions of black women as teenage mothers, welfare recipients, mammies, or exotic sexual playthings remain unchanged. For fear that telling their stories will fulfill society&#39;s implicit expectations about their sexuality, most black women have retreated into silence. Tricia Rose seeks to break this silence and jump-start a dialogue by presenting, for the first time, the sexual testimonies of black women. Spanning a broad range of ages, levels of education, and socioeconomic backgrounds, twenty women, in their own words, talk with startling honesty about sex, love, family, relationships, and intimacy. Their stories dispel prevailing myths and provide revealing insights into how black women navigate the complex terrain of sexuality. Nuanced, rich, and powerful, &lt;i&gt;Longing to Tell &lt;/i&gt;will be required reading for anyone interested in issues of race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Tears came to my eyes several times reading some of the stories, and I wanted to jump into the book and hug and congratulate each woman on revealing their personal journey.<br /><b><i>Longing to Tell: Black Women Talk about Sexuality and ...</i></b> | Tricia Rose turns academic research into a literary masterpiece. She interviewed 20 African American females with various ethnic backgrounds, broad range of age, and socioeconomic upbringing. Rose organized the real life commentaries on sex, intimacy, relationships, and race into a narrative that will carry you through a broad range of emotions.<br /><b><i>Longing to Tell: Black Women Talk about Sexuality and ...</i></b> | “In Longing to Tell, Tricia Rose shares something all too rare: a good conversation with trusted women friends. The emotional power and raw poetry of these candid accounts compels our attention while gently nudging us to contemplate the larger narrative of race, class, color, sexuality and gender within which each intimate story unfolds.” —Lani Guinier, Bennett Boskey Professor of Law, Harvard Law School<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Longing to Tell - Tricia Rose</a> </h3></p><hr/>
