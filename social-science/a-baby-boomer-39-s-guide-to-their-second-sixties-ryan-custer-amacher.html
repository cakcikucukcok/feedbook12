  <title>A Baby Boomer&#39;s Guide to Their Second Sixties - Ryan Custer Amacher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While this book was written for male Baby Boomers and their significant others, it also includes Boomer history and what lies ahead as we experience the decade of our own sixties. This story reviews our Boomer luck, recounts the great history of being a kid in the 1950s, and the great opportunities provided by improved education in the 1960s, not to ignore a seemingly mind expanding culture. Turning sixty is not for the faint hearted. There are issues ahead. The first thing we all face is taking care of aging parents or what the author refers to as helping your parents check out. Then there are our own Boomer health issues including cataracts and prostate cancer. You likely think there is nothing funny about these topics but the quirky economist author finds humor in all of our aging experiences. This book covers Boomer issues, all in the context of our Boomer culture. We Boomers thought we would be young forever. Maybe that is why it is so amusing. RYAN CUSTER AMACHER was born 52 days too early to be an &quot;official&quot; Baby Boomer, but he in no way ever considered himself a member of Tom Brokaw&#39;s &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot; In this book, the author chronicles the good luck of the first sixty years of the Boomer experience and guides Boomers into the humorous, but sobering experience of their personal sixties. Amacher, an economist, has a BA degree from Ripon College and a PhD from the University of Virginia. He has been a professor at the University of Oklahoma, Economics Department Chair at Arizona State, Business Dean at Clemson University, and President of the University of Texas at Arlington where he is now a Professor of Economics. He has worked at the Pentagon, writing a market plan for the All-Volunteer Army, the Federal Trade Commission as a consultant, and the US Treasury, on the Law of The Sea negotiations." />
