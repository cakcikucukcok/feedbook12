  <title>Just One Shift - Catherine Marfino-Reiker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this gripping new non-fiction novel from Catherine Marfino-Reiker,
author of  999 Officer Down, a veteran police officer is driven to the brink of mental collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;J U S T   O N E   S H I F T&lt;/i&gt;
delves deep into the mind of a big city street cop as he confronts one impossible situation after another during the busiest shift of his career. An intense recounting, which discloses the officers thought process as he makes repetitive, split-second, life and death decisions that have life-long effects on the people involved.&lt;/p&gt; 
	This candid summation of a ten-hour evening shift takes him from the totally ridiculous and laughable to the intensely outrageous and, at times, even gruesome. The senseless murder of a young girl pushes him beyond his emotional limits. He begins to question his own abilities, and regresses to memories of a period 10 years earlier. When he finally believes he can regain his sanity, another explosive incident occurs, thrusting him to a level of uncontrollable exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
	These heart-warming and tragic moments will generate feelings of sympathy and compassion never before associated with a law enforcement officer." />
