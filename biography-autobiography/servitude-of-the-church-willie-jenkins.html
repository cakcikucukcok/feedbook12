  <title>Servitude of the Church - Willie Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WARNING!  Explicit language Do not read any further if you are not seriously interested in developing the kind of heart that God is free to use whenever, wherever, and however He desires.
As you embark upon this journey of becoming a true servant in Gods kingdom by reading this book, you will discover: 
	Your ministry is birthed through serving
	The role that obedience plays in winning Gods favor and approval
	God supplies the strength needed to serve
	Serving God gives Him permission to shine through you
Servitude of the Church: A Pocket Guide to Developing a Servants Heart presents the experiences of the author, Willie Jenkins, as he illustrates the path one may follow to cultivate a heart dedicated to serving God. In his testimony, he shares how God revealed to him the ways that obedience could lead to a life of blessing through service.
By holding up the journey of one individual who left behind his former habits of sin to enter into a life of submission to Gods will, Servitude of the Church will help readers to discover four truths: ministry is birthed through serving; obedience to God yields His favor and approval; God supplies the strength for ones service; and serving God enables Him to shine through ones life.
Servitude of the Church: A Pocket Guide to Developing a Servants Heart will challenge you to rethink not only how you serve in ministry in your local church, but also how you live the rest of your life." />
