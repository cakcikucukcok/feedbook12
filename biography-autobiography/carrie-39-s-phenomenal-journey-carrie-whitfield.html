  <title>Carrie&#39;s Phenomenal Journey - Carrie Whitfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carries Phenomenal Journey vicariously takes you along on this wild journey of love. We stroll Parisian streets; hike the sandy roads of Niamey, Niger; mingle with people; and immerse ourselves in cultures. Sometimes we watch, laugh, or sigh and assimilate together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened Carries Phenomenal Journey and was smitten with a young African American girls dream of an education. I followed this heroineand I dont use that word lightlythrough falling in love to the betrayal and divorce. Carries dream had not died, and soon she found hope and fulfillment in education and a promising career in education. But life was nowhere over. I celebrated as Carrie moves to Paris to study the language in preparation for her service in Niger, West Africa. I flew over the Sahara desert with Carrie, saw the blue men of the Taureg, and clapped with the colorful tribe women under Carries nurturing wing. As her days in the field came to a close Carrie returns to family and creating a home in Jacksonville, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carol ODell, author of Mothering Mother: A Daughters Humorous  and Heartbreaking Memoir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An informative and entertaining book written by someone who spent years living with the peoples of Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
