  <title>Tilted - Steven Skurka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Conrad Black’s new appeal, Steven Skurka is back to deliver a thorough, in-depth account of the controversial businessman’s legal difficulties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It was the trial that captivated observers on both sides of the Atlantic. Media titan Conrad Black, by turns respected and reviled for decades in Canada and around the world, faced off with U.S. prosecutors on charges of criminal fraud stemming from his activities with Hollinger International. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;As the only Canadian writer to attend the trials of Conrad Black, lawyer Steven Skurka delivers a thorough, in-depth account of the controversial businessman’s legal difficulties. Skurka offers analysis, insights, and personal anecdotes to present the clearest picture of the trials to date, featuring interviews with key members of the prosecution and defence, as well as a peek into the jury room during final deliberations. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;In the first edition of &lt;i&gt;Tilted&lt;/i&gt;, Skurka showed how the prosecution attempted to &quot;tilt&quot; the trial in its favour, but he also demonstrated how Black unsuccessfully attempted to tilt the trial his way. Black lost his appeal to the Court of Appeals and began serving a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence in Florida. Black’s legal battles moved to the U.S. Supreme Court, followed by a second appeal in Chicago and leading eventually to a dramatic conclusion. Now Skurka brings the reader up to date on all of the recent developments in Conrad Black’s case, including new interviews and behind the scenes strategy. &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
