  <title>Parsonage in a Pear Tree - Arlo T. Janssen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arlo Janssen, the author of PARSONAGE IN A PEAR TREE, writes about his being brought up in a small town in Minnesota in the 1930&#39;s and early 40&#39;s. The large family, of which he was number seven, lived in a parsonage, next to the church, where his father was the pastor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the family was poor, humor abounded in their home life. They were able to smile in virtually all circumstances. The title of the book comes from their singing, as a joke, the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; with the words, &quot;And a Parsonage In a Pear Tree.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book contains episodes and information from the life of the children in the family, especially the youngest. Arlo, number seven of ten siblings, was &#39;&#39;the oldest of the youngest.&#39;&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some episodes are touching; some are humorous; all are interesting. People who have been brought up in small towns say, when they read the book, that they can identify with almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARSONAGE IN A PEAR TREE is not Christian book, as such; however, it definitely has a heartwarming Christian message in various chapters. The Janssens were all committed Lutheran Christians.&lt;/p&gt;" />
