  <title>Game 7, 1986 - Ron Darling, Daniel Paisner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every little kid who&#39;s ever taken the mound in Little League dreams of someday getting the ball for Game Seven of the World Series. Ron Darling got to live that dream - only it didn&#39;t go exactly as planned. In &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;Game 7, 1986&lt;/i&gt;, the award-winning baseball analyst looks back at what might have been a signature moment in his career, and reflects on the ways professional athletes must sometimes shoulder a personal disappointment as his team finds a way to win. Published to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the 1986 New York Mets championship season, Darling&#39;s book will break down one of baseball&#39;s great &quot;forgotten&quot; games - a game that stands as a thrilling, telling and tantalizing exclamation point to one of the best-remember seasons in Major League Baseball history. Working once again with &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; best-selling collaborator Daniel Paisner, who teamed with the former All-Star pitcher on his acclaimed 2009 memoir &lt;i&gt;Game 7, 1986&lt;/i&gt;, Darling offers a book for the thinking baseball fan, a chance to reflect on what it means to compete at the game&#39;s highest level, with everything on the line.&lt;/p&gt;" />
