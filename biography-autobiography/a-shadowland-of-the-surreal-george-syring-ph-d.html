  <title>A Shadowland of the Surreal - George Syring, Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The alien enigma continues to gain more interest as information on the subject increases. Books are widely available along with information through the computer as well as various news media. Knowledge alone, however, does not prove aliens already are among us. Positive proof hinges on some sort of personal experience such as abduction or missing time. The vicarious alien experiences you will have through me in this book are the next best thing to personal experience. Denial and disbelief are likely as you walk in my shoes and meet my alien contacts. You cannot read about these experiences anywhere else as they are unique to me. I am genetically a part of the alien enigma.   -George Syring  Texas, 2017" />
