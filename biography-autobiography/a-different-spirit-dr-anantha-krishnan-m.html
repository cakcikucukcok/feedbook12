  <title>A Different Spirit - Dr Anantha Krishnan M</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is an inspiring biography of noted paraplegic Indian athlete Malathi K. Holla. A Different Spirit captures the trials and turbulences of Malathi, who despite undergoing 33 surgeries and many setbacks in her life, never gave up and won over 300 medals for India in various international championships. Written by leading defence journalist and blogger Dr Anantha Krishnan M, A Different Spirit is being hailed by the media as one of the most inspiring stories of our times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Different Spirit is the first project of Bangalore-based Inspired Indian Foundation (IIF), a writers&#39; movement backing unsung heroes. As the founder President of IIF, the author has pledged the royalties from the book to support the cause of unsung heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IIF hopes to raise funds through the sales of A Different Spirit (now into its sixth edition), for Malathi&#39;s dream of building a permanent structure for Mathru Foundation, a home for paraplegic children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
