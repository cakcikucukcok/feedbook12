  <title>I Ranked 10Th in the Nation in Total 2012 Presidential Votes on a 00 Dollar Budget Whats Next? 2016! - Richard Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard Duncan believes there are four major problems or causes that he views have led to a decline in America, namely, too big of a government, the rise of socialism, Democrats and Republicans feuding, and the negative influence of money on politicians and campaigns. Duncan, who believes that this decline can be prevented, offers as a solution, that being the independent voters movement. He sets forth three chapters to support independent voters and their organizations, first, the United States Supreme Courts affirmation of the rights of independent voters and secondly, a discussion of a growing national independent voters association. A third chapter briefly discusses how this movement could reform our dysfunctional government by progressing toward a free people to control the limited government as envisioned by our founding fathers." />
