  <title>A Life Well Built - Joyce Perry Fisher, Lee Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the tapestry of human history and experience, some individuals rise above the fabrics common braid and seem destined for great achievements. Richard Fisher was one of these souls. In A Life Well Built, author Lee Kelley tells the story of this natural-born leader who was an extraordinary soldier, father, husband, pilot, engineer, and friend.&lt;p&gt;
Raised in Ohio, Richard Dick Fisher showed natural signs of leadership at a young age. This biography spans his lifetimethrough ninety years and twenty-six countriesand touches on his widespread successes. It follows him from the Ohio State University School of Engineering, to the Pennsylvania Railroad, to his work as an engineer in Ohio, and to building airports for the Army during World War II. A lifelong pilot, he flew airplanes and managed operations for Air America. He co-piloted the last aircraft to escape Saigon when the Vietnam War began and retired from the Army as a brigadier general.&lt;p&gt; 
A Life Well Built shows the depth of this man who accomplished feats that most people could only dream of. This biography demonstrates that Fishers life was a solid, inspired piece of engineering; he created a personal masterpiece in the art of living." />
