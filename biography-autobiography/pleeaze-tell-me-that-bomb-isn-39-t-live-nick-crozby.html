  <title>Pleeaze! Tell Me That Bomb Isn&#39;t Live! - Nick Crozby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pleeaze! Tell me that bomb isnt live! is a follow on from Nick Crozbys successful first book, Pleeaze tell me that wasnt a teacher. Like its predecessor it continues in a humorously written, anecdotal style and is based on the multifarious events and incidents the author, Nick Crozby, has been privileged to encounter, enjoy and occasionally suffer during his long career in education. The events related were real but the names of all those involved have been changed to preserve anonymity. Pleeaze! Tell me that bomb isnt live describes how it was a working visit to Saudi that led to a totally unexpected change in direction to his and his wifes newly established teacher recruitment company. That in turn led to exciting, sometimes difficult but always interesting experiences and events in countries across the world. Helping set up new schools in Eastern Europe, Bahrain and China, advising and helping to staff and improve established schools in the Caribbean, Africa and Hong Kong all as a result of an initial visit to the Middle East. The scariest times were as a result of the Gulf Wars and visits to Kuwait, Qatar, Dubai in the aftermath. With his well-chosen stories and incidents Nick not only entertains but informs the reader about the nefarious, colourful behind the scenes goings on in the international educational world. 
The dialogue is colourfully illustrated with many carefully recalled situations, some sad, others naughty and some very moving. Incidents and characters seemed to follow him during his time in teacher recruitment just as they had during his teaching career and these too are humorously related." />
