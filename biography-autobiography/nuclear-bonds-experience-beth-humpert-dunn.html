  <title>Nuclear Bonds Experience - Beth Humpert Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nuclear Bonds Experience is a persistent womans hunt for healingbody, soul, and spirit. All along, she craves God, whose loving presence and quiet voice guide her steadily forward. Raised in the Catholic Church, saved in the Jesus Movement, taught in the Faith Movement, healed in the Charismatic Movement and the African American Church, she ultimately must face the prospect of returning to her spiritual roots.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hers is a coming-of-age story that parallels two arenas of her professional life: film and fences, the kind around the nuclear weapons complex. She believes that if she can just complete her independent film about the nuclear world before she goes deaf from NF2 disease, she will have accomplished her dream and fulfilled her destiny. To do so, she endures church splits, loss of relationships, and barriers to documentary filmmaking in the US and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear Bonds Experience is the memoir of an inquisitive young girl who leaves behind a preVatican II faith characterized by hellfire and brimstone, then spends forty years in the Protestant realm searching for Gods love and healing power. While her hearing vanishes, Gods voice sounds with new clarity in her heart, but he seems to be leading somewhere she is reluctant to go. Not until she reckons with a long-buried offense against the Catholic Church does she fully obey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
