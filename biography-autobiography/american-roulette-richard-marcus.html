  <title>American Roulette - Richard Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;American Roulette&lt;/i&gt;, Richard Marcus tells his never-before-heard story, of ripping off casinos. The book follows Marcus, along with several of the world&#39;s great professional casino cheaters, as he travels from Las Vegas to London and Monte Carlo, pilfering large sums of money from casinos by performing sleight of hand magic tricks with gaming chips. As skilled cheaters, they back up their moves with psychological setups to convince pit bosses that they&#39;re watching legitimate high rollers getting lucky, while in fact they&#39;re being ripped off blind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the exploding growth of casino gambling, heightened by Indian reservation and riverboat expansion, more and more elaborate casino cheaters are illegally assaulting the green-felt, getting rich off of novice casino personnel. Richard Marcus&#39;s insider story is a window into the hidden world of intriguing personalities and tense situations he encounters as a member of expert casino-cheating teams who use their wits to turn the odds upside down and &quot;earn&quot; millions. &lt;i&gt;American Roulette&lt;/i&gt; is a fascinating story not only for those who occasionally casino-gamble, but for everyone with a little larceny in their heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
