  <title>Memoirs of a Royal Air Force Oil Rag - Bob Blackmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An incredible life that spanned for nearly a century...  Robert Collins Blackmore, or &#39;Blackie&#39; as he was known in the RAF, grew up as a sickly child, but would soon become one of the unsung heroes of World War Two.  Stricken with family tragedy, the young Blackmore continued with his fascination with anything mechanical, only to find more hardships to follow.  Honoured with the Atlantic Star for bravery, burned in a freak engine room explosion, and meeting Winston Churchill on a cold and sinister night, are just some aspects of this humble unpresuming man.  This is the story of one man&#39;s fight for survival, lost love, and an inner strength to knuckle down and get the job done.  Bob left the RAF to enjoy the rest of his life with his wife Jacque until his passing in 2009 at the age of 92.  Excerpt &#39;BANG! - My right knee was torn apart as I was blown past the starboard engine gear lever. I was thrown out of the engine room, over the well deck, and smashed into the cabin entrance.&#39;  Bob Blackmore" />
