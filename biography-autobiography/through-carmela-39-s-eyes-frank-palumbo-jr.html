  <title>Through Carmela&#39;s Eyes - Frank Palumbo Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a young girl, an Italian immigrant, who was brought to America in hopes of a better life. Times were hard and her parents were forced to take her out of school, at age twelve and send her to work in one of the woolen mills in Lawrence Massachusetts. While there, she endured a devastating accident that would forever alter her life and that of her family.  The repercussions  would extend far beyond anything  that could be imagined.  Carmela Teoli, after spending seven months in a hospital, would go on to testify to a Congressional Committee about the conditions under which she, and the other children, had been forced to work. Her words had the power to influence many people including the First Lady, Helen Taft , who had been in attendance at the hearings. Mrs.Taft  quickly took Carmela under her wing to the extent of inviting her to spend the night at The White House. Clothing, a warm bed and a delicious dinner were all provided for her. Carmela conversed freely with The President and his wife that evening about everything that she and her family had been through. The next day she would meet with more congressional members where she could further relay her plight. Following the  Congressional testimony, working people were entitled to better conditions. The Bread and Roses strike of 1912  had made an impact on labor regulations as had the testimonies of the children." />
