  <title>I Went for a Walk - Gabriel Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just over a year ago I decided I wanted to go for a walk, a rather long one. I had a plan. I&#39;d use my home in London as a base and strike out into the countryside, starting small - short jaunts to Brighton or Norwich, leading up to walking London to Penzance and finishing my year with a walk to Edinburgh. That was the plan. And it couldn&#39;t have gone more wrong.  &lt;em&gt;I Went for a Walk&lt;/em&gt; describes the idiocy of attempting to walk 1000 miles around the UK on my year off before Uni. The book is full of sarcasm and self deprecation but hey, it wouldn&#39;t be British without those. I wanted to see the country I grew up in, meet its people, end my long, tiring days in random local pubs, dancing along to acoustic nights. I met kind people, strange people, I saw the entry to the Channel Tunnel, I almost fell in a river and I joined a covert mission to close a coal mine. I set out to discover the UK but in the process, discovered truths about myself, my mind, my body and their limitations that surprised and changed me.  What began as simply the idea of thoughtlessly spewing out my experience on to a page slowly turned into an exploration of my deteriorating mental state throughout the year. Whether this be the occasional political rant, the in-depth analysis of Coldplay and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&#39;s voice or the slighter darker tone of attempting to understand the negative thoughts that filled my head. Trudging through the British countryside with only a tent, a camera and a backpack for company was an interesting experience to say the least... In essence, this book explores the everyday peculiarities of life navigating the no-man&#39;s land between school and university, and my attempts at understanding my new place in the world, whilst mixing in the occasional moment of me cooking Ainsley Harriot&#39;s cous cous by the side of a road on a dodgy gas stove." />
