  <title>Dopefiend: A Father&#39;s Journey from Addiction to Redemption - Tim Elhajj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Long-distance relationships are never easy, and the relationship described in this book between a recovering heroin addict and his son growing up in a faraway state is proof of that axiom. However, no matter the difficulties, the author uses the principles learned in his twelve-step program to forge a powerful bond between himself and his son as that boy grows to maturity and a new closeness with his father-and his father&#39;s second family. Heartwarming and hope-inspiring, &lt;EM&gt;Dopefiend&lt;/EM&gt; also chronicles the help the author was able to give his son when the &#39;family disease&#39; of addiction threatened the young man&#39;s life." />
