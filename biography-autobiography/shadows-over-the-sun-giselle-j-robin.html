  <title>Shadows over the Sun - Giselle J. Robin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This compulsively readable autobiography traces the journey of a remarkably courageous woman from a childhood under Nazi Germany, through her marriage and then emigration to Australia to make a new start by developing an organic winery in McLaren Flat in South Australia. After traumatic experiences she has had to battle with bipolar mental disorder. Giselle tells her story in flawless prose and with compelling honesty. This is the story of a strong woman adding to the growing literature on women&#39;s lives. The story takes you in from the first page and never lets you go.&lt;br&gt;DR. BASIL MOORE, PHILOSOPHER/LECTURER&lt;p&gt;An honest and precise account of a life journey, demonstrating life struggle and 
immense resilience of the author to bounce back and reinvent herself. Great buoyancy shown for the life by Giselle as she immerses herself in her many endeavors.&lt;br&gt;- VESNA ILICIC, SOUTH AUSTRALIAN WRITERS CENTRE&lt;p&gt;Triumph of the spirit over adversity.&lt;br&gt;- BILL GUY, JOURNALIST, EDITOR AND WRITER&lt;p&gt;I cannot believe the strength and courage of Giselle.&lt;br&gt;- MEMBER OF UNITY HOUSING COMPANY 
&lt;p&gt;I found the story most informative and have enjoyed reading it.&lt;br&gt;- LORRAINE ROSENBERG, MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ONKAPARINGA&lt;p&gt;Giselle&#39;s story is a story of the triumph of determination and optimism in the face of tougher challenges than many of us could imagine surviving. An interesting read indeed.&lt;br&gt;- JENNY RUSSELL, EDITOR AND FOUNDER OF THE GREEN DIRECTORY TRADING CO. PTY LTD&lt;p&gt;What a truly amazing life Giselle has led. Her book is bursting at the seams with the full panoply of what life can bring  or throw at us. Giselle&#39;s story has it all. I was warmed by her spirit in truly tough times and her irrepressible sense of adventure that has helped her to pick herself up and get on with life. After her difficult journey through episodes of mental illness which led to spiritual healing she has no doubt much wisdom to share with others on a similar journey.&lt;br&gt;- ANNA BYAS, MENTAL ILLNESS FELLOWSHIP SOUTH AUSTRALIA 
&lt;p&gt;A life with so much sadness and trauma begs the question of how Giselle Robin survived. However, she not only survived but has ultimately triumphed over a mental illness  which was mismanaged most of the time. Again and again Giselle has picked up the shards, worked out how to piece them together and then got on with life. Her story  in all its innocent frankness  is an inspiring one.&lt;br&gt;- HON.
