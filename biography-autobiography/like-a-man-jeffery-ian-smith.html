  <title>Like a Man - Jeffery Ian Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I thought of dedicating a book in honour of my fathers life and his work, and when I began to put together the outline, I suddenly realized how much his examples -though simple - are in fact precious and humble directives that can help men in general, any particular man, to start life well, to develop progressively through the stages of life, to fight and win in life despite the obstacles and to end life with a real sense of achievement, like a man.
Examples of good men - dead or alive - are not so far-fetched anymore, and although they are not readily sought after, they are still very special. It is sad the kind of disregard that is given to concepts such as role modelling, coaching and mentoring in a world where the benefits of engaging them (the ideas and the practices) are so important and seriously needed. 
Jesus was and still is a very good role model, coach and mentor. While He was here on earth, His life echoed goodness of diverse kinds as He sought to fulfill His mission of genuine, radical transformation. His examples of taking care of people, submitting to authority and for diligent work etc., are tried and proven, although they are arguably not the easiest to follow. However, those who followed Him as His direct reports (Peter, John, James, the other disciples) and thousands of others who believe His method for success in life, are relentless in their efforts at encouraging as many more persons as possible, and especially men, everywhere to follow along.
Our Daddy evidently had the same characteristics as these and other great men of the world, the only difference is that he operated at a different level and I am proud etching his name in my first book publication because he gave me so many good reason to.
He had a heart for children, he loved helping others, he gave a lot of his time and energy to doing Church work unconditionally, he was serious about business, he connected well with all types of people, he gave of cash and kind to as many as had need, even more than he could afford and he was man enough to repent and forgive. 
The eight examples presented in this book might not be the greatest stepping stones for life and success in general. They most probably will never be advanced as official theories, but I am confident that they can be followed by any young man who is committed to making good out of life to the advantage of himself and his family." />
