  <title>A Part of  My Journey - Henri  R R Evictus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through some of my experiences, I found myself questioning God, myself, the universe, about the purpose of life. I believe that we all ask these questions at different points in our lives, and it is these questions that bring us together. It is our search for God, for peace, for love, that ties us all together. It is my hope that in sharing my story that we may begin a dialogue of what it is that we have in common. There is enough focus on the differences. Let us turn the tide from division and fear toward love and unity. I believe that, through love, we can create an effective change in our world and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In sharing my story I hope to provoke a soulful discussion of who we are and our purpose in life. Through the example of my life experience, I offer the truths of what I learned as a template of my beliefs. We all have a story to tell, and in telling mine I hope to offer a compelling case for what I believe in. We are all unique individuals with our own experiences. My aim is to ask thoughtful and compelling questions that allow the reader to form their own truth. I feel that this is important, for it offers empowerment rather than dogma.&lt;/p&gt;" />
