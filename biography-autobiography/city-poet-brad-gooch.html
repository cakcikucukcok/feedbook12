  <title>City Poet - Brad Gooch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The definitive biography of Frank O&amp;#8217;Hara, one of the greatest American poets of the twentieth century, the magnetic literary figure at the center of New York&amp;#8217;s cultural life during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;City Poet&lt;/em&gt; captures the excitement and promise of mid-twentieth-century New York in the years when it became the epicenter of the art world, and illuminates the poet and artist at its heart. Brad Gooch traces Frank O&amp;#8217;Hara&amp;#8217;s life from his parochial Catholic childhood to World War II, through his years at Harvard and New York. He brilliantly portrays O&amp;#8217;Hara in in his element, surrounded by a circle of writers and artists who would transform America&amp;#8217;s cultural landscape: Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Helen Frankenthaler, Jackson Pollock, Gregory Corso, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, LeRoi Jones, and John Ashbery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gooch brings into focus the artistry and influence of a life &amp;#8220;of guts and wit and style and passion&amp;#8221; (Luc Sante) that was tragically abbreviated in 1966 when O&amp;#8217;Hara, just forty and at the height of his creativity, was hit and killed by a jeep on the beach at Fire Island&amp;#8212;a death that marked the end of an exceptional career and a remarkable era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;City Poet&lt;/em&gt; is illustrated with 55 black and white photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
