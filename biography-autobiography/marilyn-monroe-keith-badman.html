  <title>Marilyn Monroe - Keith Badman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published for the fiftieth anniversary of her tragic death, this definitive account dispels the rumors and sets the record straight on her last two years&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marilyn Monroe passed away at the age of thirty-six under circumstances that have remained mysterious to this day. &lt;i&gt;Marilyn Monroe: The Final Years &lt;/i&gt;separates the myths and rumors from the facts as Keith Badman takes readers through the concluding months of 1960 to that fateful day in August 1962. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this extraordinary book--the product of five years of exhaustive research--the author is both biographer and detective: Badman uncovers long-lost or previously unseen personal records, exclusive interviews, and eyewitness accounts that illuminate the final chapter of Marilyn&#39;s life as she navigates weight gain, drug use, an dpersonal turmoil, along with drama on the set of the ill-fated movie &lt;i&gt;Something&#39;s Got to Give&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Badman dispels popular beliefs, such as her supposed affairs with John and Bobby Kennedy. (Monroe only had a one-night stand with the president at Bing Crosby&#39;s house, and never with Bobby.) Readers learn the long-concealed identity of her biological father, who refused Marilyn&#39;s attempt to contact him in 1951--and was then repaid with her apathy ten years later when he attempted to contact her. The author also reveals the details of her famous &quot;last Sitting&quot; with photographer Bert Stern (which was &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;her last photo shoot) and describes the horror she endured after being tricked into being institutionalized at the Payne-Whitney Psychiatric Clinic, from which ex-husband Joe DiMaggio had to pull strings to secure her release. Perhaps most shockingly, we learn of the regrettable incident in which a drunken Monroe was sexually exploited by mobsters at a Lake Tahoe hotel co-owned by Frank Sinatra. Finally contrary to the salacious rumors that Marilyn was suicidal or the victim of a murder and cover-up, Badman discloses new information about her final days alive and reveals, in unequivocal detail, evidence that indicates Monroe&#39;s death was accidental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above it all, Badman pays homage to Monroe by rescuing her final months from the realm of wild and sensationalized allegations popularized by those who sought to gain from them. &lt;i&gt;Marilyn Monroe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: The Final Years &lt;/i&gt;sheds new light on an immortal movie legend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
