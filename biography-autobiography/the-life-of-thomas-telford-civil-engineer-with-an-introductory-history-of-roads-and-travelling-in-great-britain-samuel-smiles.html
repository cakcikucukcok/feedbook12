  <title>The Life of Thomas Telford, Civil Engineer / With an Introductory History of Roads and Travelling in Great Britain - Samuel Smiles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With an Introductory History of Roads and Travelling in Great Britain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The present is a revised and in some respects enlarged edition of the &amp;#39;Life of Telford,&amp;#39; originally published in the &amp;#39;Lives of the Engineers,&amp;#39; to which is prefixed an account of the early roads and modes of travelling in Britain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From this volume, read in connection with the Lives of George and Robert Stephenson, in which the origin and extension of Railways is described, an idea may be formed of the extraordinary progress which has been made in opening up the internal communications of this country during the last century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among the principal works executed by Telford in the course of his life, were the great highways constructed by him in North Wales and the Scotch Highlands, through districts formerly almost inaccessible, but which are now as easily traversed as any English county.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By means of these roads, and the facilities afforded by railways, the many are now enabled to visit with ease and comfort magnificent mountain scenery, which before was only the costly privilege of the few; at the same time that their construction has exercised a most beneficial influence on the population of the districts themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Highland roads, which were constructed with the active assistance of the Government, and were maintained partly at the public expense until within the last few years, had the effect of stimulating industry, improving agriculture, and converting a turbulent because unemployed population into one of the most loyal and well-conditioned in the empire;&amp;mdash; the policy thus adopted with reference to the Highlands, and the beneficial results which have flowed from it, affording the strongest encouragement to Government in dealing in like manner with the internal communications of Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;
