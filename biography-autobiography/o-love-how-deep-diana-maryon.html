  <title>O Love How Deep - Diana Maryon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The autobiographical novel &lt;i&gt;O Love How Deep&lt;/i&gt; by Diana Maryon contains striking insights into relations between the sexes, Christian discipleship, and mastering disappointment. I hope that I shall see it in print in some form in due course. J.I. Packer, Author and Theologian&lt;p&gt;
&quot;I knew from the first 100 pages that I was going to be enthralled with this story, and so I was, right to the end. I literally couldn&#39;t put it down. Of course, it doesn&#39;t seem like the end because I still want to know more about Hope.&lt;p&gt;
The loving portraits of the authors two children were the highlight for me. Why that is so, I don&#39;t know. Perhaps the honesty about motherhood.&lt;p&gt;
It is a fine adult-Christian book and should enjoy a wide readership.&quot;  Mary Razzell, Author&lt;p&gt;
After twenty-six-year-old Australian David Carpenter, a psychiatrist and neurological researcher himself, had a breakdown in his first year at Cambridge, his therapist told him, Go into the Anglican Chaplaincy, investigate Christianity, and have a love-affair with a nice Christian girl. He did precisely that. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diana was only twenty. They grew so close that when, after four years, she married someone else, he returned home devastated. They did not meet again for eight years. He realised then that he still loved her, and she him. He asked her to break her marriage for him. Instead, she sent him away indefinitely.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her last letter she begged him to give her up. She said that Oxford had rejected her dissertation. She was thirty-three, with her academic career now shattered.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the poignant true story of three hyper-intelligent, cosmopolitan, and highly-educated people fighting their way through to genuine faith, hope and love in the modern world.&lt;p&gt;" />
