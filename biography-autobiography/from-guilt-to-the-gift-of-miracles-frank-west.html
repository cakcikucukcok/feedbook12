  <title>From Guilt to the Gift of Miracles - Frank West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Frank West courageously tackles one of the most important issues in A Course in Miraclesdealing with the ego mind.  He is wonderfully open in sharing his intimate life experiences and dreams with us, modeling effective ways of not letting the ego block his return to Love.  His authentic and well-written book will be a source of inspiration to many.                 
                Henry Grayson, PhD, Author of Mindful Loving and The New Physics of Love
    .....a remarkable memoir of lessons learned, of growth from illusionary ego-living to fulfillment and well-being where Peace and Love abide.  ....a fascinating  first book, Frank writes with great sensitivity and vulnerability that teaches without teaching.  I commend it to all on the Journey.
         Nan C. Merrill, author, Psalms for Praying
In Frank Wests beautiful memoir From Guilt to the Gift of Miracles, we find the journey of a
soul leading progressively through illusion, unhappiness and nightmares to a purging of darkness and the realization that; it is only as we learn to forgive and let go of illusion (i.e. nothing) that we can be healed ourselves and thereby have the opportunity of help others.
Jon Mundy Ph.D.
The Institute for Personal Religion - Publisher of Miracles magazine
In From Guilt to the Gift of Miracles, psychotherapist Frank West gives us an intimate and moving memoir of his lifes journey of over eighty yearsfrom his growing up poor in a Pennsylvania coal town during the Depression, through his war experiences during World War II, to his postwar search for inner peace and true contact with the miraculous. His search led him first to the Christian ministry, then to a career as a psychotherapist and family counselor, and finally to his discovery of the remarkable spiritual path known as A Course in Miracles. Frank offers the reader the opportunity to benefit in a very real way from the personal experiences he recounts here, for it is Franks belief that the way the therapist heals his patientand by extension, all his brothers and sistersis by doing the long, careful, and ultimately holy work of healing himself. That is the healing Frank offers us in this remarkable book. That, and his unmovable faith that each and every one of us has already in his own mind the Love that is his true home, and that, together, we will find it." />
