  <title>From the Darkest Places Come the Brightest Lights - Bob Solis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Bob and Sallie Solis of the Phoenix area took their life savings to start a home for orphaned children in South Africa. After seeing so much suffering caused by AIDS on a family mission trip, they felt called to do something to ease the pain of children they encountered.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Bob Solis movingly recalls some of the most poignant stories from an incredible journey which has given 55 children a home to call their own. Bobs strong Christian faith and commitment to service gives him deep insight into the wonderful journey that led to the founding and growth of Open Arms Home for Children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;From the Darkest Places Come the Brightest Lights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bob Solis has written a book from the depths of his heart with imagination, humor, wit, compassion and unwavering trust in Divine Providence. I highly recommend this book. Reading it will enrich your life. 
-Father Joe Corpora, C.S.C. University of Notre Dame&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Coach Jim Valvano said there are three things we should do every day. Number one is laugh. Number two is think. Number three is have your emotions moved to tears. I did all three by the sixth page of this book! 
-Duane Kuiper, Major League Broadcaster and former big leaguer&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful book about life, love and faith. While they are too humble to admit it, Bob (aka Bobo) and Sallie are heroes  at least for the children who are blessed to live at Open Arms. We have been there and it is heaven on earth for these kids. If you want to be inspired to listen carefully to your own calling, read this book. I loved it. 
-Addison Tad Piper, Former Chairman of the Board, Piper Jaffray Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This powerfully moving book is like observing a master songwriter craft his Magnum Opus  it will inspire you, encourage you and most profoundly cause you to ask yourself, How can I sit in my rocking chair when the house is on fire? 
-Rev. Dale Hopely, Jr., Senior Pastor, The Church at Litchfield Park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Foreword by Randall McDaniel, Member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame&lt;/p&gt;" />
