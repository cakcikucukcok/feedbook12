  <title>Like Any Normal Day - Jr. Mark Kram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 2013 PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing, &lt;i&gt;Like Any Normal Day &lt;/i&gt;is a profound, powerful narrative of a golden boy&#39;s tragedy, a woman&#39;s unlived life, and a brother&#39;s complicated devotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the mid-1970s, brothers Buddy and Jimmy Miley were close, both on the verge of impressive athletic careers. A promising high school quarterback, Buddy&#39;s potential was cut short by an injury that left him quadriplegic. Immobile and imprisoned in his body for decades, Buddy would watch life pass by from his wheelchair, living at home under his mother&#39;s and brother&#39;s care, and wondering what his life could have been. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buddy and Jimmy visited special hospitals and traveled to Lourdes in search of a miracle, never losing hope as they searched for a cure. But as Buddy suffered increasing pain, and also realized that he would never be able to walk again--and never prove himself capable of being loved by Karen, a woman he&#39;d first met in high school--he asked Jimmy to help him end his life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully written, both heart-wrenching and hopeful, Mark Kram Jr.&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Like Any Normal Day&lt;/i&gt; explores the important bonds between families and the depths of what we&#39;re willing to do for those we love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Like Any Normal Day &lt;/i&gt;is the winner of the 2013 PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
