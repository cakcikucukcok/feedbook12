  <title>Monk&#39;s Tale: The Presidential Years, 1987-2005 - Edward A. Malloy, C.S.C.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This long-awaited, last installment of Reverend Edward A. Malloy&#39;s three-volume memoir examines his eighteen years as president of the University of Notre Dame from 1987 to 2005. In this candid and lively account, Malloy, or &quot;Monk&quot; to all who know him, shares his reflections on his presidency following the long-term leadership of Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C. Malloy describes his transition into the presidency, his approach to leadership, issues related to Catholic identity, the importance of fund-raising, and finding the proper balance in intercollegiate athletics. Communication issues were of paramount importance during Malloy&#39;s tenure, and he discusses how he fostered good relationships with the surrounding community, and supported trustees, administration, faculty, and other important constituencies in the governance of the university. An inveterate multitasker, he also examines how he organized his office and schedule, worked with administrative associates, handled a busy domestic and international travel schedule, sustained his participation in numerous external boards, and kept in regular contact with alumni and friends of the university. Finally, he looks at controversial issues, providing an insider&#39;s account of various challenges and crises, from personnel problems to NCAA sanctions to concerns about presidential succession. During nearly two decades, Father Malloy met with presidents and movie stars, sports legends, benefactors, and university employees, many of whom are mentioned in this book. Throughout this volume, Malloy&#39;s love for Notre Dame and its students, faculty, and staff comes through clearly, along with his overwhelming sense of gratitude for the opportunity to lead a university where faith, community, and service are taken seriously and passed on from one generation to the next." />
