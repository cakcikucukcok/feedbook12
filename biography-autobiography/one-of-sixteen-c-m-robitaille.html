&lt;P&gt;At a very young age Cora learned how to become extremely loyal to disloyalpeople in herlife. Feeling like she was always a shadow behind her twin sister, Cora grew up feeling like she did not exist even though she knew she was very much alive. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Even when she had doubt, she knew she was alive by placing her hand on her chest to feel her heart beat just to reassure herself.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After years of humilation Cora decides to head into Canada to escape,only to find herself so conditioned to a disloyal and abusivelife that she returns back to Vermont and marries right into the life she struggled so hard to get away from. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After thirty years of living with a replica of her father, Cora finally with the help of Alanon and several counselors learns that she has been addicted to addicts her whole entire life. finally breaking free she removes herself from the only life she ever knew. &lt;/P&gt;
