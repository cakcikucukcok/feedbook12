  <title>A Sea of Rage Inside of Me - Doreen Hawkins Heath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever been in a new place, and it seems like youve been there before?  In grade school, I had this eerie feeling so many times that I took notice after a while.  I stared at the scenery, waiting for an extraordinary experience to happen. 
I realize now that I was too young then to understand the connection, but at that time, I was being led into a dj vu visit.  Perhaps I once lived before this lifetime.  Powerful isnt it?  
	Maybe I am the reincarnated soul of my biological ancestry or of Jarena Lee (Lee, The Life and Religious Experience of Jarena Lee), one of the first African-American women to pen an autobiography (Lee, Biography of Jarena Lee).  Nevertheless, I am who I am because there is no other person who is just like me.  Who I was before is not as important as who I have becomea supporter of the beacon of light which shines brightly inside of me." />
