  <title>Tears of My Angel - Benedetta Lino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is unpredictable. When we least expect it, it can be changed forever. That moment came for author Benedetta Lino when her one-year-old daughter was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, the possible result of a serious adverse reaction to the DPT vaccination. Yet in the years to come, Benedetta refused to give up hope and refused to let her daughter experience anything less than true and unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartwarming, yet bittersweet, &lt;i&gt;Tears of My Angel&lt;/i&gt; recounts the years of struggle, pain, love, and hope that the Lino family endured. Benedetta recounts the early years of her daughters life, of the numerous tests and hospital stays, until the diagnosis ?nally came in 1985. But from that moment on, things only became more di?cult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Benedetta and her husband learned to care for their daughter in the comfort of their home, they found strength in each other and in the love they had for Laura. As the years passed, and the normal milestones of a childs life passed with-out being celebrated, the family instead celebrated the beauty of life, of Lauras courage, and of the power of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tears of My Angel&lt;/i&gt; inspires, educates, and encourages, but most of all, it rea?rms the ability of hope and love to sustain us through our darkest days.&lt;/p&gt;" />
