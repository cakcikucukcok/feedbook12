  <title>There Will Always Be Tomorrow - Vern Thornton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If one could go back to the time of the Big Band era and walk into a ballroom where the orchestra was playing a dreamy ballad, such as  Well Be Together Again, and listen closely to the lyrics..No tears, no fears, there always will be a tomorrowWell be together again, then you could see how, and most importantly why, the title of this book came about. This book could also be an unforgetable love story of a romance that had everything going against it, but one lasting over 60 years. It could also be an adventure epic of world wide travel to include a trip on the now defunct Concorde. It could also be a glimpse into the lives of people living in a small Connecticut town. It could be all of these things and much more, and in truth, it is.
If you go back to the Roaring Twenties you can follow the life of this man who hails from Jewett City, Connecticut, a small textile manufacturing community. Follow him as he gives up a secure government job to become a newspaper reporter, bureau chief and then editor with dramatic and often humorous events of those times.
A telephone call from a state senator leads him off in another direction, this time in law enforcement with careers both in Connecticut and Florida prison systems where he eventually gets his own command with the Broward Sheriffs Office.
His final journey takes him to the Florida Attorney Generals office where he becomes founder of a nationally acclaimed program.
Throughout this book you will meet and get to know some of the most fascinating people found anywhere." />
