  <title>Travel, Research and Teaching in Guatemala and Mexico - Mark Curran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is entitled Travel, Research, and Teaching in Guatemala and Mexico: In Search of the Pre-Columbian Heritage (volume I, Guatemala). 
This book in its totality of two volumes has various facets: it is comprised of anecdotes and thoughts on travel, research, and teaching in Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico from 1962 to 2000; it is a reflection on important topics and concepts of pre-Columbian culture, and finally, it is a summary of classroom guidelines and Professor Currans notes on a major work on the civilizations of pre-Columbian Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico and important documentary films on the same. Volume I treats Guatemala and Honduras. 
Again, volume I on Guatemala treats modern urban cities and rural towns near the pre-Columbian sites: Guatemala City, Antigua, Lake Atitln, Chichicastenango, and towns of the Verapaces in Guatemala. The well-known pre-Columbian sites in volume I are Copn in Honduras and Tikal in Guatemala. In addition, an overview of the latter is seen in a textual and pictorial summary of the holdings of the Museo de Antropologa e Historia in Mexico City, the best of its kind. 
The book is richly illustrated with black-and-white travel photos by Curran." />
