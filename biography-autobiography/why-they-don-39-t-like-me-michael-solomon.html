  <title>Why They Don&#39;t Like Me - Michael Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life is too short Calvin, Im not ready to go home yet, and I am sure that God isnt ready for me to take my place on the thrown as of yet. So I tell you guys that they better wrap it up before they slap it, or they will be six feet under getting slapped by there friend Mr. Satin himself. So you are saying Stephen that you have never penetrated someone unwrapped? Put it like this man, back in the days there was not all these diseases as it is now. If we did anything, (which we did) we got a shot in the ass and we were able and ready again. Those were the days. There isnt any one from the old school that cant say that they didnt slide it in with out a rubber, they would be lying. But now man, I dont care if you are Shemar Moore, I want to cover up. Dont get me wrong, not saying that he has anything, but I want to protect myself. I plan on being around for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe thats how Calvin lost his life, when he was Gay banged. Even though he was beaten real bad, broken ribs, fractured jaw. But those four guys had penetrated him, and told him that he needs to get out of town. We dont like your kind here, you put a bad name on us guys. What I dont understand about these so call men, and I did say so call men. If they were this so call str8t, why did they penetrate Calvin. That has me to believe that there are very few so call str8t guys out there. In my opinion every guy likes to get there we-we wet from time to time by another guy. They dont want to admit it, because it would take away from there man hood. But I hate to say that there man hood was already taken when they first laid eyes on another man. So dont judge me because of what I am, just love me for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;" />
