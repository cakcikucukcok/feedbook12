  <title>A Funky Christmas - Lucy L. Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Christmas of 1976 was fast approaching the projects of Wheeling, West Virginia, a town ensconced in the wintery mountains. This Christmas, with all of their hearts desires, would be like none other. One family would be introduced to death, hope, a shortage of black dolls, and a new sound called funk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Funky Christmas&lt;/i&gt;, author Lucy L. Lowe shares the anxieties and excitement of her and her six African-American sisters ranging in age from two to fourteen as they become intertwined with an overwhelming desire to get down dancing to a new sound called funk. All hope is lost for fourteen-year-old Reza, who vows to run away to Soul Train if she doesnt get a Loud Mouth eight-track tape player for Christmas. When eight-year-old Destiny hears that the Lord has called a family friend home, she convinces her younger siblings to take the phone off the hook. Meanwhile, as a shortage of black dolls sweeps the mountain community, six-year-old Ashley and four-year-old Cassey make a request that puts Santas reputation on the line.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Funky Christmas&lt;/i&gt; narrates a Christmas memoir of one family, raised by a loving single mother, who shared a deep love and faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
