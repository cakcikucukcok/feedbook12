  <title>The Other Shoe Dropped - D. L. Moutsiakis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Demetrius Moutsiakis is just twenty years old and already in his first year of medical school at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Life is good, and hes looking forward to a promising career as a doctor.&lt;p&gt; 
As a Greek-American in 1989, Demetrius is also joining the rest of the world in celebrating the collapse of the Soviet Union. He looks forward to riding his bicycle to school and spending time with his parents and two siblings.&lt;p&gt;
But his life comes to a sudden halt when he wakes up in a room he doesnt recognize. Hes intrigued by a mysterious milky-white liquid in a plastic bag that he eventually identifies as a feeding device. &lt;p&gt;
The truth soon becomes clear to Demetrius: Hes suffered a traumatic head injury, and hes just woken up from a coma. It will take all the strength he can muster to rehabilitate his body and mind so he can pursue his future once more.&lt;p&gt;
Join Demetrius on his personal journey from the heights of adolescent promise to the depths of rehabilitative hell. Hell seek to find a more measured and treasured existence in &lt;i&gt;The Other Shoe Dropped.&lt;/i&gt;" />
