  <title>They Called Us Nazi’S N----S and White Trash - Gittel Maria Barankowitcz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All throughout, the story weaves around WW2 and the bombing of Berlin, Germany.  Berlin as an island was divided by four nationalities and surrounded by the Russian zone.  The book also depicts the life of a mixed marriage between a black US Army sergeant and a white German girl, who also brought her all-white daughter into the marriage.  The couple had four racially mixed children.  Army life was fun and easy, but after the tour of enlistment ended, their lives changed drastically.  Living as a mixed family in the 1950s and 1960s in America turned them into a hunted family unit.
              The book also gives remembrance to the yellow Juden stars and the six million Jewish people who died in the concentration camps. WW2 leaves a bad taste in the writing, but the Russian Occupation and their take over after the war was a self-lived and very scary experience as told in the book.
                Also, toward the end of the story is a description of a granddaughter living in Cairo, Egypt, at the same time as the people in Cairo rebelled. There was WW2  again with the tanks, the airplanes, and the military raids.
A special thanks to you, America for saving us time and time again from Hitler and the Russian Occupation in Berlin, Germany." />
