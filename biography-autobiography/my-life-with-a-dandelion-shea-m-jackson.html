  <title>My Life with a Dandelion - Shea M. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By reading about my journey of the hearttrial, tribulations, and overall triumphsI hope that you are encouraged by the miracles that my family and I witnessed in the life of my special-needs child. When things looked the darkest, it was our heavenly Father that gave us the light to continue to move forward in our wilderness journey. 
While most of these pages have come directly from the pages of my personal journal, I have chosen to omit the names of some people and places to protect the innocent and guilty alike. Ive also chosen to refer to my daughter in this story by her nickname, LuLu, as that is what she likes to be called. I will honestly admit to you that this book has brought healing to me, although it was difficult and very painful for me to relive some of the events of the past. My hope for you, dear reader, is that you will acquire a better understanding of just how precious life truly is and that no life should be considered less valuable than another. 
My husband and I have had the privilege of living in the house that belonged to his grandmother. Weve been able to raise our three children in the same house that holds so many childhood memories for him. Its located in Millbrook, Alabamanorth of the states capital, Montgomery. Living in this city has given us the warm feeling of family and a sense of comfort with its Southern charm and friendly faces. With our corner lot, our azalea filled yard, and our house full of memories, I sat down to record every step of my journey with our little dandelion. 
Why, yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes 
(James 4:14)." />
