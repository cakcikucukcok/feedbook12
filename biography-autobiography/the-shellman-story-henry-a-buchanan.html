But the people of that little Church in that little town said they would not allow their Pastor to say such a thing because it was contradictory to their hallowed traditions.

Here in THE SHELLMAN STORY Henry Buchanan has told how it all happened fifty years ago. But because it seemed so strange to the people who heard him and saw it all happen in Shellman Georgia, Buchanan has included some tales from his boyhood which show how the boy who grew up in a racially stratified home and community became the man would challenge the Southern Tradition of his own people, and be hanged in effigy for it, and in the end be fired by the Church he served as God&#39;s spokesman in a time of great crisis and turmoil because he believed he was Right.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
