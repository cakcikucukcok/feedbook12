  <title>Basia - Barbara Marchwicki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Basia is an emotional journey of a woman through childhood and adolescence into a turbulent adulthood full of revelations and deceptions. 
As a teenager, Basia observes the complete deterioration of her parents marriage and her mothers struggle to keep her family and kids together. She knows her mother desperately hangs on to the memories of her first love, but the memories are too painful to share. When her mother dies when Basia is just twenty years old and her father goes through a selfish stage, she is forced to grow up quickly. She leaves her family home and the small town she grew up in and vows to never return. 
Within the layers of self-discovery lies the profound need to be loved. She makes mistakes and bad decisions, but she never loses the clarity of her aim; to never end up like her parents and marry only for love." />
