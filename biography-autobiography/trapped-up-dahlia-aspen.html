      <meta name="description" content="Arts &amp; Entertainment, National Geographic, Dateline, 48 Hours, and American Jails TV series have portrayed the inside of our countrys worst jails and prisons. I have always been fascinated during my incarceration I wondered why the jail did not warrant a story. 
County jail is a city within walls inmates become complacent with the self-contained structure, three meals, a cot, cable TV, and other amenities keep the revolving door spinning inmates to and fro in the penal system. 
The journey from sally port to cell is an experience you will not have anywhere overwhelming about the women who choose this way of lifestyle, trapped up in an atmosphere providing sense of security and added supplementary basic necessities for daily life. 
Repeat offenders violation of parole/probation and/or new charge(s) go through the booking and classification formalities that can have inmates held for months to years before transfer to an upstate prison.
Trapped up will take the reader on a journey through few county and state penal systems in new jersey for women who conform to this separate way of life without day-to-day assumed responsibilities as civilians." />
