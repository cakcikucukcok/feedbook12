  <title>Best Day Ever: Finding My Way - D. Adam Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author Adam Goldberg strains to understand  his  relationship with his father. As he reviews their history during a phone conversation with him, he experiences an epiphany that illumines his vision of his dad. Rather than compounding his father&#39;s failures, Adam&#39;s enlightened awareness enables him to recognize and appreciate his father&#39;s attributes.  This intuition multiplied and led to inspired observations about truths to be found in common life challenges and answers to such questions as,  &quot;What do you get out of not enjoying your work?&quot; And, &quot;Does it make you happy to think that way?&quot; These expanded reflections, and an examination of the circumstances and situations that provoked them, compelled the writing of this book. The author tells us, &quot;I quit a great job to write this book.&quot; We should all be glad that he did.  BEST DAY EVER is  a practical and inspirational life story that surveys  signal moments in life. Together, we consider responses guaranteed to increase happiness and personal growth. Adam confirms, &quot;We know the truth when we see it.&quot; Interestingly, BEST DAY EVER was written for both self and others. Adam&#39;s Pop, beloved step-father and &quot;Worker Guy&quot; in the Work chapter,  observed, &quot;Adam, this book is for you.&quot;   So, together, the author and the reader grasp and gather nuggets to live a happy, balanced and productive life.  &quot;It all starts with you. No, not you, me.&quot;" />
