  <title>Between Meals - A. J. Liebling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; staff writer A.J. Liebling recalls his Parisian apprenticeship in the fine art of eating in this charming memoir, &lt;i&gt;Between Meals: An Appetite for Paris&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;There would come a time when, if I had compared my life to a cake, the sojourns in Paris would have presented the chocolate filling. The intervening layers were plain sponge.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his nostalgic review of his Rabelaisian initiation into life&#39;s finer pleasures, Liebling celebrates the richness and variety of French food, fondly recalling great meals and memorable wines. He writes with awe and a touch of envy of his friend and mentor Yves Mirande, &quot;one of the last great gastronomes of France,&quot; who would dispatch a lunch of &quot;raw Bayonne ham and fresh figs, a hot sausage in crust, spindles of filleted pike in a rich rose &lt;i&gt;sauce Nantua&lt;/i&gt;, a leg of lamb larded with anchovies, artichokes on a pedestal of foie gras, and four or five kinds of cheese, with a good bottle of Bordeaux and one of Champagne&quot;--all before beginning to contemplate dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In A.J. Liebling, a great writer and a great eater became one, for he offers readers a rare and bountiful feast in this delectable book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an introduction by James Salter, PEN/Faulkner Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;A Sport and a Pastime&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
