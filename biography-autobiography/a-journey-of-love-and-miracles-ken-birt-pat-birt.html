Each was looking for a friend to spend some time with; they could not imagine the events they would come to experience together as they began their relationship. In A Journey of Love and Miracles, they tell the story of how they met and got engaged, and how Pats cancer diagnosis changed the course of their love affair and their lives. This is a story of faith, love, and miracles that should be shared with others who face cancer, its prognosis, treatment, and the aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;
