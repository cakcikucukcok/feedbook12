  <title>Memoires of a Travelholic - Carole J. Kuhn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Kuhn has written a book about her life and travels as a foreign language teacher. In essence, it is a book of memories, autobiographical in nature.  She describes many of the 45 trips in detail,  but she also groups many of the trips togeher. In 1973 when she began taking students to Europe, she had a good background of working with students and knowing how they think and act. (or so she thought) There is an interesting list of things to take, where to put the items, where they can be bought and the prices of the items. There is also a list of personal rules and regulations that were required of all students. They were called Mademoiselles Rules or Mlles Rules.  Then there is a comprehensive list of Trip Procedures, giving all the do&#39;s and dont&#39;s of traveling.  Students were allowed to &quot;sample&quot; beer and alcohol as long as their parents had signed a permission slip, but  students will always try to outthink the teacher and circumvent the procedures.  Dr. Kuhn describes many of the things that went wrong on both student trips and adult trips, along with things  that didn&#39;t seem funny at the time, but in retrospect seem humorous today." />
