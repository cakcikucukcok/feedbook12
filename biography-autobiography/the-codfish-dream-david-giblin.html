  <title>The Codfish Dream - David Giblin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A colourful portrait of life in an eccentric fishing village on the BC coast.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending fifteen years as a fishing guide on the BC coast, David Giblin decided that the offbeat people and places he encountered during that colourful period in his life had to be preserved. Like any good fishing story, wherein the fish seem to grow faster after they are dead, the forty-seven interconnected narratives in what eventually became &lt;i&gt;The Codfish Dream&lt;/i&gt; took on a life of their own. The result is a series of hilarious, strange, keenly observed, true (or mostly true) stories of Giblin’s experiences, held together by a thread of international intrigue that affects everyone in the small community of Stuart Island over one eventful summer, when FBI agents visit the island to investigate insider trading. &lt;i&gt;The Codfish Dream&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable book imbued with an undeniable sense of place and time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
