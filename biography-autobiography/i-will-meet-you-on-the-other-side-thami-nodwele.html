  <title>I Will Meet You on the Other Side - Thami Nodwele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about my life from the time I was born and how I was born, my upbringing, and the number of different kinds of experiences I had while growing. I have decided to base the story in this book on the time when I did not know the Lord up to the time I was saved.
I have been encouraged to do so because I felt I experienced quite a lot of weird situations, more than some people do. I think it is best to let others know how some other individuals experience life so that they can learn something out of their not-so-good stories.
There were situations I came across, bad or good, which built and changed my character as a person for the better. I became stronger and wiser through hardship and through training I received in different aspects of life. It was not an easy path for me, but I do not have much regrets of how I was raised because even if I did, I cannot change my past.
I can only learn from it and be of help to others where I can. In everything I have said in this book, the best thing that happened to me and I am proud of was my salvation. I do not take my salvation lightly; I am very grateful that I am saved. If I could, I would persuade and preach to every individual I come across up to the ends of the earth that they can accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior.
Because hell is real and heaven is real, and irrespective of the two, one cannot befriend his Fathers enemy. One needs to love and be obedient to his Father." />
