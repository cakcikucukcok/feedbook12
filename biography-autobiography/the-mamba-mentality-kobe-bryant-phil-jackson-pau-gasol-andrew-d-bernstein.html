  <title>The Mamba Mentality - Kobe Bryant, Phil Jackson, Pau Gasol, Andrew D. Bernstein</title>

Readers will learn how Bryant studied an opponent, how he channeled his passion for the game, how he played through injuries. They&#39;ll also get fascinating granular detail as he breaks down specific plays and match-ups from throughout his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bryant&#39;s detailed accounts are paired with stunning photographs by the Hall of Fame photographer Andrew D. Bernstein. Bernstein, long the Lakers and NBA official photographer, captured Bryant&#39;s very first NBA photo in 1996 and his last in 2016--and hundreds of thousands in between, the record of a unique, twenty-year relationship between one athlete and one photographer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The combination of Bryant&#39;s narrative and Bernstein&#39;s photos make &lt;i&gt;The Mamba Mentality&lt;/i&gt; an unprecedented look behind the curtain at the career of one of the world&#39;s most celebrated and fascinating athletes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
