  <title>Leather Hinges - Nila Braden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leather Hinges is a true story of May and Exter Stanfords life in a dug-out home in Oklahoma in 1901.
As May drove the heavy loaded wagon, she smiled at the ridiculous cow and her husbands patience. Rosie, the milk cow, absolutely would not move unless someone walked with her. Surprisingly, Exter seemed to admire the independent spirit of Rosie. Little five year old Tom was half asleep beside her. The other wagons were wheeling along. This was truly Gods country. We can be really blessed to live in this country. Then May would think, Are the Indians happy with this situation? Not many years past, one could lose his scalp for entering their territory. And even if the Indians are friendly, what about rattlesnakes, wolves, bobcats, coyotes? There doesnt seem to be enough trees to build houses. But God has led us into this situation. We will just have to believe that the Indians will share their space with us." />
