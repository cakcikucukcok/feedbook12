  <title>Chapter and Verse - Bernard Sumner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bernard Sumner pioneered the post-punk movement when he broke onto the scene as a founding member of Joy Division, and later as the front man of New Order. Heavily influencing U2 and The Cure while paving the way for post-punk revivalists like Interpol, Sumner&#39;s has left an indelible mark on punk and rock music that endures to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famously reluctant to speak out, for the first time Sumner tell his story, a vivid and illuminating account of his childhood in Manchester, the early days of Joy Division, and the bands subsequent critical and popular successes. Sumner recounts Ian Curtis&#39; tragic death on the eve of the band&#39;s first American tour, the formation of breakout band New Order, and his own first-hand account of the ecstasy and the agony of the 1970s Manchester music scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witty, fascinating and surprisingly moving, &lt;i&gt;Chapter and Verse&lt;/i&gt; is an account of insights and spectacular personal revelations, including an appendix containing a complete transcript of a recording made of Ian Curtis experiencing hypnotic regression under the Sumner&#39;s amateur guidance and tensions between himself and former band member Peter Hook.&lt;/p&gt;" />
