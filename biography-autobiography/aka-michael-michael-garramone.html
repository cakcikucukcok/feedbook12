  <title>AKA Michael - Michael Garramone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a young boy born to two hard working Italian parents, as an only child, in an affluent area of Queens New York, with a very bright future. That all came to a crashing end the morning his mother shot and killed his father while he sat out in front of one of their stores&amp;nbsp;when he was 12. The story then goes on a multitude of different types of stories, as he adapts, to the ever changing places he finds himself in. It is a kaleidoscope of different feelings, thoughts, emotions, environments and locations. It could almost be viewed as a modern day Oliver Twist, with a twist. Oddly, it is free of self-pity, even through the self destructive portion.&amp;nbsp;It winds through deaths, street life, jail, drug addition, street fights, financial ruin, and personal near death experiences. It is also a story of self determination to better himself through will, strength, and a need to succeed,&amp;nbsp;even though life shows him that it is not ready to release him from the fate it has bestowed upon him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
