  <title>A Childhood Memoir - Melanie Lowy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The stomping of black-booted automatons; the drums beating in tune
to murderous chants of hatred a retentive memory of a little girl
has captured it all. Her early, serene Munich childhood wiped out: a
school in flame, a journey alone to England ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gone is the school she loved. Parted from her adored father with whom
she endured prison and worse. Stored away safely is her memory of GRAF
ZEPPELIN, the hideous faces of the Nazi leaders and her love of Munich.
KINDERTRANSPORT to England aged nine without friend or language
leaves her traumatised unused as she is to cope with caring for herself.
Stays at holiday camps; with a kind, generous Jewish family in London,
then it is off once more with Jewish schoolchildren to Bedfordshire weeks
before WW2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A love affair begins with the English country-side and its animal inhabitants.
Evacuated to an ancient farm house with no amenities whatever, where she
is joined by her pious old grandmother, she settles down to school-life in
this strictly orthodox school, new friends all refugees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through her father, a well-known poet, she discovers what is happening to
Jews in Europe early on and her faith is shattered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contrasting tale of two childhoods, one recalling a deceptively idyllic
beginning; the other an awakening in a strange but charitable land and the
forever haunting realisation of what has been done to her people.
This is a unique portrait of childhood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
