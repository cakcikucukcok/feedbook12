  <title>Line Of Communications - Sondra Garner, Manuel Freedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Line of Communications is based on the true story of an Air Force Officer who was assigned to a tour of duty in Turkey in 1963. Moreover, it is the story of his young wife and their small children who joined him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tells of her heart-wrenching fight to save him from certain death at the hands of the Turkish Government. The desperation she felt and the unfaltering courage she showed while ensnared in a tug of war between two countries&amp;mdash;two different worlds&amp;mdash;is unimaginable! You will feel the fear of two parents when their son was kidnapped!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey was at war politically with Cyprus at the time of her husband&amp;rsquo;s deployment. The Turkish Government was resolute in their commitment to force the United States to support the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a means to gain leverage against the United States, the Turkish Government arrested three American military men on trumped-up charges and held them as political prisoners. The Turkish Government, determined to prove they were in control, would escalate the charges according to the amount of pressure the Turkish authorities wished to assert against the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back home in the United States, there was no mention in the news media about the military men held in prison. It is clear the United States Government was committed to keeping the matter quiet at all costs.This is a poignant story of ardent love, humor, intrigue and unmitigated fear! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
