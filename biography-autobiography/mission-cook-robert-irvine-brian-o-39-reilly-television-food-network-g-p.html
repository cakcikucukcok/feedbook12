  <title>Mission: Cook! - Robert Irvine, Brian O&#39;Reilly, Television Food Network, G.P.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The star of Food Network&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Dinner: Impossible&lt;/em&gt;, Chef Robert Irvine shares the adventurous story of his life, his thoughts on cooking, and his favorite recipes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are few chefs on the planet who do what Irvine does, flying around the world at a moment&#39;s notice to cook for heads of state, royalty, and celebrities. Irvine reveals his fascinating past and unorthodox culinary training. His career as a world-renowned chef began at the age of fifteen when he was discovered by Prince Charles while cooking in the mess halls of the British Royal Navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Mission: Cook!&lt;/em&gt; Irvine tells the wild stories of his career, from studying under the best European chefs to cooking for three thousand refugees on a beach while civil war raged in South Yemen to preparing an Oscars feast while coordinating the biggest chefs in the business. Sprinkled throughout are Irvine&#39;s most incredible recipes from his travels around the world, including Roasted Duck with White Bean Ragout, Truffle Oil, and Shaved Parmesan Cheese; Tea-Smoked Chicken; Lobster Risotto with Clams; and his ethereal Windsor Angel Food Cake. Easy to prepare and deliciously satisfying, these are dishes that everyone will savor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irvine&#39;s candid stories and behind-the-scenes look at the creation of his Food Network TV show &lt;em&gt;Dinner: Impossible&lt;/em&gt; prove that the life of a celebrity chef is anything but ordinary. As is &lt;em&gt;Mission: Cook!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;a unique and fascinating look into the mind and life of one of the world&#39;s hottest chefs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
