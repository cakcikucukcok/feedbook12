  <title>Stand up and Live - Audrienne Roberts Womack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A family patriarchs voice is heard clearly from the past in Stand Up and Live. It is that voice that has spoken with urgent meaning for author Audrienne Roberts Womack. She did not meet her great-great grandfather Anthony Dangerfield Sr., a visionary freedman who commenced the evolution of the Dangerfield/Roberts lineage into well-educated, prosperous citizens of the United States, but it is his inspiration that started this book. Anthony Sr.s lack of education motivated him in wanting his children to become educated, which led him to build a school on his property, to harness his familys combined intelligence for progress, and perhaps had a vision of what the family is now and how Audrienne Womack knows it. His children and his descendants will most certainly know how to appreciate his vision through this book. It is also a well-written one that will put it among the ranks of outstanding family histories that help define significant portions of the American experience. At first, like many young women her age, Womack could not recognize the importance and significance of her family history. It was her father, Horace Molvin Roberts Sr., who constantly reminded her, embedded in her memory, at least, the fact that on her may very well rest the hopes that their family history would not be forgotten." />
