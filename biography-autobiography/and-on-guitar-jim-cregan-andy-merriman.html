  <title>And on Guitar... - Jim Cregan, Andy Merriman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jim Cregan is an English rock guitarist, songwriter and producer, who in a career spanning fifty years has recorded numerous albums with stars such as Cat Stevens, Family, Willie Nelson, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, Joe Cocker, The Gypsy Kings and Katie Melua among many others. However, he is perhaps best known for his 40-year association with Rod Stewart, as both his guitarist and co-writer/producer. In And on Guitar..., Cregan lifts the lid on an extraordinary career in which he toured with Elton John as part of the Blossom Toes, recorded two albums with Family, was recruited by Steve Harley to form the new Cockney Rebel (his sublime solo on their hit single ‘Come Up and See (Make Me Smile)’ is considered to be one of the best). And on Guitar... recounts Cregan’s early life, his burgeoning music career, extraordinary tales of hedonism, and features a Who’s Who of music’s biggest stars." />
