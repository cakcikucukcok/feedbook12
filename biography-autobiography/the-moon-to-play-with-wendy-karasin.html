  <title>The Moon to Play With - Wendy Karasin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This inspirational memoir travels one womans road to generational adulthood as she resists, then embraces, her parents aging and eventual deaths. Wendy Karasins descriptive passages offer readers the opportunity to experience the normalcy and enormity of what happens in her life. As Wendy is pushed into a caregiving role that grows exponentially, she must surrender to an inability to alter her parents fate. Her pain morphs from engagement to acceptance, and ultimately compassion. The experiences that unravel her also transform her. With seventy-nine million baby boomers and forty million seniors, the imperative requirement for conscious end-of-life conversation has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Moon To Play With&lt;/i&gt; is more than the memoir of the authors loss of both parents. Beautifully written, Wendy Karasin shares the sensitive transition to true adulthoodas defined by the moment when one is no longer anyones child. Wendy gracefully takes us on her journey with the understanding that this path is one we all walk at some point. She writes with emotional transparency, and without the triteness that can accompany a subject so sensitive. Wendy Karasins story is that of a universal experience, told with grace and soul.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
