  <title>The Tastemaker - Edward White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A revealing biography of the influential and controversial cultural titan who embodied an era&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tastemaker&lt;/i&gt; explores the many lives of Carl Van Vechten, the most influential cultural impresario of the early twentieth century: a patron and dealmaker of the Harlem Renaissance, a photographer who captured the era&#39;s icons, and a novelist who created some of the Jazz Age&#39;s most salacious stories. A close confidant of Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, George Gershwin, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Knopfs, Van Vechten frolicked in the 1920s Manhattan demimonde, finding himself in Harlem&#39;s jazz clubs, Hell&#39;s Kitchen&#39;s speakeasies, and Greenwich Village&#39;s underground gay scene. New York City was a hotbed of vice as well as creativity, and Van Vechten was at the center of it all.Edward White&#39;s biography--the first comprehensive biography of Carl Van Vechten in nearly half a century, and the first to fully explore Van Vechten&#39;s tangled relationship to race and sexuality--depicts a controversial figure who defined an age. Embodying many of the contradictions of modern America, Van Vechten was a devoted husband with a coterie of boys by his side, a supporter of difficult art who also loved lowbrow entertainment, and a promoter of the Harlem Renaissance whose bestselling novel--and especially its title--infuriated many of the same African-American artists he championed. Van Vechten&#39;s defense of what many Americans considered bad taste--modernist literature, African-American culture, and sexual self-expression--created a popular appetite for these quintessential elements of American art. &lt;i&gt;The Tastemaker&lt;/i&gt; encompasses its subject&#39;s private fears and longings, as well as Manhattan&#39;s raucous, taboo-busting social scene of which he was such a central part. It is a remarkable portrait of a man whose brave journeys across boundaries of race, sexuality, and taste helped make America fully modern.&lt;/p&gt;" />
