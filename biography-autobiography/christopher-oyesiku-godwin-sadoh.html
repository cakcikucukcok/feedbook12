  <title>Christopher Oyesiku - Godwin Sadoh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;CHRISTOPHER OYESIKU&lt;/b&gt; dazzled the Nigerian elitist 
music caucuses with his
extraordinary bass voice and God-gifted talent for well over six 
decades. His
outstanding performances brought smiles, laughter, joy, and 
admiration to the faces
of his faithful patrons, patronesses, and audiences. Nigeria has 
never seen nor
heard anything like Oyesikus magnifi cent voice that is best 
described as bel canto
and basso profundo. With this sonorous voice, he always leaves 
an impeccable
and memorable impression on his ardent afi cionados. He has 
performed before
the cream of Nigerian society, African nations, dignitaries, and 
indeed, the
Royal Family in Great Britain. Oyesiku is a professionally trained 
classical bass
singer, choral conductor extraordinaire, music educator, erudite 
scholar, concert
promoter, concert manager, concert connoisseur, and 
broadcaster. From a period
that spanned 1963 to 1997, Oyesiku single-handedly directed 
four magnifi cent
choirs: the Lagos Musical Society Choir, the Nigerian Broadcasting 
Corporation
Choir, the Oyo State College of Education Choir, and the 
University of Ibadan
Choir. He trained these choirs to perform at a very enviable lofty 
standard that
always leaves their audiences screaming for encore at the end of 
every concert.
Their performances were consistently eclectic, electrifying, 
emotive, joyful,
impeccable, crisp, energetic, fl awless, and intercultural. This 
book succinctly
introduces musicians and enthusiasts to the performance of 
classical music
in Nigeria through the life and stunning career of Christopher 
Oyesiku. His
repertoire, bass solo recitals, and choral performances are indeed 
the epitome of
art music concerts in the country. In this book, we can see how 
art music is taught
and learned, organized, directed, performed, promoted, 
managed, disseminated,
patronized, and preserved by the elitist group in modern day 
Nigeria. In other
words, the Christopher Oyesiku concerts are representative of 
art music decorum
in Nigeria, with particular emphasis on the performance 
practices, and a mirror
through which one could examine the ethos of this brand of 
music in twenty-fi rst
century Nigeria.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;GODWIN SADOH&lt;/b&gt; is a Nigerian ethnomusicologist, 
intercultural
musicologist, composer, church musician, organist, pianist,
choral conductor, and prolifi c publishing scholar with over
90 publications. His compositions have been performed
and recorded worldwide. He is the fi rst African to receive a
doctoral degree in organ performance from any institution
in the world. Sadoh has taught at numerous institutions
including the University of Pittsburgh and the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln.&lt;p&gt;" />
