  <title>The Many Faces of John Kerry - David N. Bossie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A hard-hitting, ruthlessly honest political biography of Sen. John F. Kerry that will expose the real views of and dig up all the dirt on the 2004 Democratic nominee for president.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Prince Albert&lt;/em&gt;, he dethroned Al Gore. Now, David N. Bossie, former chief investigator for Congress, is going after John Kerry and giving every conscientious voter a chance to see the truth about this year&#39;s Democratic candidate. Using his trademark in-depth investigating, Bossie gives readers the real scoop on the presidential challenger-fully exposing Kerry&#39;s peculiar voting record; early Naval discharge (so he could protest the Vietnam War); self-contradictory positions on such vital issues as health care, education, and campaign finance; and shady political dealings he&#39;d rather voters not know about. With an exclusive jailhouse interview with former Kerry finance chairman, David Bossie has the insider&#39;s access and the hard-nosed investigator&#39;s savvy to ferret out the truth and present it to readers in a gripping, no-nonsense style. He lays bare Kerry&#39;s flip-flops, lies, and duplicitous stances on the war in Iraq, defense spending, tax cuts, Medicare, and corporate greed and corruption-finally unveiling all of Kerry&#39;s public and private faces.&lt;/p&gt;" />
