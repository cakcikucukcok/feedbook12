  <title>Forever Blue: The Memoirs of a Lanier High School and University of Kentucky Football Coach - Willie Moseley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They still call him &quot;Coach.&quot; Bill Moseley closed out his career as a football player and coach almost 60 years ago, but his former players still call him &quot;Coach,&quot; because his mentorship has meant that much to them over the decades. Growing up hardscrabble in Depression-era Montgomery, Alabama, Bill began his playing days at Sidney Lanier High School. He garnered a scholarship to the University of Kentucky, where he played for two years before joining the U.S. Army Air Forces. While on active duty as a gunner on B-29s, he played another college football season and became the first player in the history of the Sun Bowl to score two passing touchdowns (a milestone he accomplished under an assumed name). After military service, Moseley played his final two years at UK (for a total of five legitimate college football seasons) under the aegis of Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant. He then coached exclusively at his high school and college alma maters, where he interpolated not only Bryant&#39;s coaching techniques, but the Bear&#39;s motivational abilities. And Moseley&#39;s players took his life lessons to heart: Many became notable and successful coaches themselves; Many became successful business and civic leaders; One became a U.S. ambassador to France; One was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Coach Bill Moseley&#39;s inspiring guidance still resonates with his former players, and his story is one of exemplary and honest leadership. It&#39;s obvious that these days, the sports world could use more coaches like him." />
