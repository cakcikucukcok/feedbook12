  <title>Sailing My Shoe to Timbuktu: A Woman&#39;s Adventurous Search for Family, Spirit, and Love - Joyce Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this fiercely candid and moving book, novelist Joyce Thompson recounts a difficult yet transforming period in her life. In words that will ring true to anyone in the &quot;sandwich&quot; generation, Thompson tells the story of her troubled marriage ending, her adjustment to single motherhood, finding new love, turning fifty, dealing with sick and dying parents, and somehow discovering a spiritual home in an ancient, earth-centered tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, she comes to terms with the blessings and specters of her own dysfunctional family. This includes her father, a distinguished judge and chronic alcoholic, and her tough, smart mother, a pioneering woman lawyer, who is slowly succumbing to Alzheimer&#39;s and whom Thompson helps to die gracefully, despite many traumatic and even ridiculous moments. But with Thompson&#39;s lyrical, personal, and evocative writing, she transforms what could have been a soap opera into a rich, moving, and funny story, full of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson&#39;s novels are about understanding the human condition, and it&#39;s no surprise she focuses that gift on her own life and the lives of her family. Elegant, wise, and witty, &lt;em&gt;Sailing My Shoe to Timbuktu&lt;/em&gt;, pulls no punches and is delightfully and compulsively readable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
