      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At a young age, Nigel Bennett was shocked to witness first-hand the real impact of&amp;nbsp;oil spills&amp;nbsp;on our natural world. After almost being shot down by FARC guerrillas on the Venezuela-Colombia border and being forced to escape Egypt while working for his father&amp;rsquo;s oil spill contingency planning company, he decided to break away and start Aqua-Guard Spill Response. Aqua-Guard now provides equipment and services that protect water, the planet&amp;rsquo;s most precious resource, in 104 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take That Leap&lt;/em&gt; recounts Nigel&amp;rsquo;s unanticipated adventures as an entrepreneur, emerging philanthropist and always avid outdoorsman. Get inside his head as he negotiates deals with the big boys and wrestles with the myths surrounding work/life balance and being an entrepreneur. Be there with him through the crazy challenges of simultaneously launching a startup and a family all the way through to the even zanier challenges of becoming a steward of Pachamama (mother Nature). Follow this daredevil as he tests his limits in extreme outdoor adventures, builds homes for the homeless with his wife and children, and discovers his big &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; with the indigenous people of the Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
