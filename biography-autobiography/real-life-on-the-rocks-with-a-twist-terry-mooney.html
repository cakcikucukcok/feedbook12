  <title>Real Life on the Rocks … with a Twist! - Terry Mooney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Real life is a series of ups and downs; for some the downs seem far more frequent and ominous than the ups. The key to a peaceful, contented life is to find a balance between accepting reality as it is and creating our own reality as we dream it. It takes determination and work, but real life is what it is, a combination of good and bad, happy and sad. What is smooth sailing one day may end up stranded on the rocks the next. But whatever happens, always seek to add your own personal twist to make it your life and no one elses.
	Real Life, On the Rocks  With a Twist! is an eclectic collection of real-life experiences told in a style reminiscent of Erma Bombeck. Read about a bear attempting to open a dumpster while standing on the lid, something we all tend to do in our own lives. Transcend generations as you read about a young girl boldy making a stand against a neighborhood bully. Warmth and humor guide the reader through the struggles and challenges of family, friendship, career, and personal loss for a young woman making her way through life on her own. Issues of love and self-esteem are presented with refreshingly subtle irony. Written with keen insight and lighthearted wit, Real Life, On the Rocks  With a Twist! is a toast to humanity and a celebration of the human spirit." />
