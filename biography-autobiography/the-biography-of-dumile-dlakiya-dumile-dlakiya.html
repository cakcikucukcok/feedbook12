them. The author gives us an insight of how hard and risky it was for him to travel
to work and all the challenges he faced in the corporate environment. There are so
many more interesting and dramatic events in Dumile Dlakiyas life that occur over the
course of his biography. One of these scenes is during his time as a young man who
just started working, we get to see his character when things do not go his way and
he had to fi ght for what he believed was right for him when he was staying in a house
in Saldahna Bay with other students. We get to know the author in his space as we
get introduced to his wife, the kids and what challenges the young man had to face
during his marriage life. The author makes decisions that affect his marriage and we
get to see how he took advantage of the changes in his life. Through all the challenges
in the authors life, he never gave up on his dreams and one of those dreams was to
publish a book about his life and he fi nally achieves his dream. He has gone under a
transformation from a mischievous young boy, intelligent young man and by the end of
the book he has gained so much intelligence that he is determined to write and make
his mark on the world." />
