  <title>Limp - Simon Eli Vella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limp&lt;/em&gt; is the darkly hilarious story of Simon Eli Vella&amp;rsquo;s epic battle with crippling introversion, substance abuse, and erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;How could this possibly happen?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Given what lay before me, how could I not have been aroused? It was less an illness than a talent. I should have joined a traveling circus.&lt;em&gt; Behold the incredible mental power and unimaginable fortitude of the Human Windsock. &lt;/em&gt;There I would stand, naked, with chest puffed and clenched fists on hips, as a parade of stunning women in bikinis strutted before me. The crowd would &lt;em&gt;ooh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ahh&lt;/em&gt;, enthralled by my incomprehensible disinterest&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, Simon is convinced there is something wrong with him. He is plagued with illness, has a nose shaped like a mountain range, and a distracting voice in his head is hell-bent on ruining his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus begins his desperate search for normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his early teenage years, Simon&amp;rsquo;s linguistic constipation forces him to rely on his actions to build social credibility, and he turns to shoplifting as a means of impressing his peers (briefly becoming the most popular kid in school as a merchant of stolen pornography). As a young adult he finds acceptance in alcohol and recreational drug abuse, triggering a dangerous descent into a social underbelly that leads to encounters with an array of strange characters and situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just when he thinks he has escaped his past demons, Simon&amp;rsquo;s former life delivers a few more unwelcome surprises, including one which results in years of expensive lawsuits&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massively entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Limp&lt;/em&gt; takes the reader on a funny, compelling and unpredictable journey that shows how everything we experience in life&amp;mdash;every flaw, every fault, every ripple and tectonic shift&amp;mdash;can lead to the place of our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
