  <title>Iconoclastic Fervor: Sally Hazelet Drummond&#39;s Road to Abstraction - Hillary Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sally Hazelet Drummond is believed to be the first female graduate of the Hite Art Institute with a masters in painting in 1952. It was during her study at the University of Louisville that she further explored Abstract Expressionism, a style that started only a decade earlier in the 1940s. In 1953 Drummond, a second-generation abstract expressionist, joined the epicenter of the movement as a member of the Tanager Gallery, one of the leading Tenth Street artists&amp;rsquo; co-ops. In the midst of figures such as De Kooning, Reinhardt and Rothko, Drummond refined her style into the &amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;dotted starburst patterns that she continued to develop over the course of her life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While Drummond has been described in several genres, ranging from neo-pointillism to op-art, her work and the exhibition itself is firmly rooted in abstract expressionism. Drummond herself described the movement as a kind of iconoclastic fervor. While history has remembered Abstract Expressionism as being a definitive style characterized largely by wall sized canvases swabbed with gestural marks of the artists, contemporary writers provide a much larger perspective that typifies the avant-gardism of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Drummond&amp;rsquo;s artistic career from her Tanager days to date has been a deepening study into her understanding of abstract expressionist practice. However, as the oeuvre of her work has demonstrated, her explorations into abstraction proffer a different albeit not unfounded view of the art movement. Drummond&amp;rsquo;s views on spirituality and community serve as a foil to much of the machismo and individualist psychology of the abstract expressionist artists. Additionally, Drummond&amp;rsquo;s use of easel scale, unrestrained use of color and deliberate art making process offer a reframing of the accepted tenants of abstract expressionism. Drummond&amp;rsquo;s art and her journey into abstraction is also deserving of the self-same description, an &lt;em&gt;iconoclastic fervor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The exhibition of her art, ranging from the 1940s until 2010, is on display in Gallery X at the Schneider Hall Galleries from November 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; until December 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2015.
