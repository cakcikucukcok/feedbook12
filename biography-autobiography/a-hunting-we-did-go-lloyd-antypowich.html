  <title>A Hunting We Did Go - Lloyd Antypowich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    To sit in natures cathedral and look down on the creators masterpiece is almost a spiritual experience for Lloyd Antypowich. Every year, for forty years,
    he took time out of his busy life and followed the call of his heart as it led him into the mountains that he loved. He revelled in their magnificence, the
    splendour of nature and the solitude that recharged his batteries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He sharpened his senses, as he pitted his skills against those of the animals that he stalked; animals that in their own territory are much more skilled
    than man, and time after time beat him in the challenge. If he got his game it was a bonus. The real success was reconnecting with nature and enjoying the
    peace that he found there, away from the stress and chaos of everyday life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Many dream of experiencing nature as he did, but he lived those dreams. In A Hunting We Did Go, True Mountain Adventures, the author takes you along on his
    journeys into the mountains. While you read, you feel like he is right there beside you, sharing his experiences with you. You feel his wonder, his awe,
    the excitement of the stalk, his exhaustion after a rough climb or hours in the saddle, his fear when he comes face to face with a grizzly bear, a cougar
    and even an unhappy moose. You will also experience his satisfaction when he outwits his prey and the effort of bringing the meat into
    camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    From his personal experience and firsthand knowledge of the subject and the settings, the author has woven a compelling read that shares the reality of
    hunting in the mountains.
