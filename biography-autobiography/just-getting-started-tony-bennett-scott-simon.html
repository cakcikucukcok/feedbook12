  <title>Just Getting Started - Tony Bennett, Scott Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At ninety, musician and singer Tony Bennett is as vibrant and productive as ever. In addition to his prodigious musical output, including albums, concerts, and personal appearances, this beloved and enduring artist has written his second book. In 2012&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Life Is a Gift&lt;/em&gt;, Tony reflected on the lessons he has learned over the years. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Just Getting Started&lt;/em&gt;, he pays homage to the remarkable people who inspired those lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his warm and inviting voice, Tony talks about who and what have enriched his own life, including Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Cole Porter, Amy Winehouse, Fred Astaire, Lady Gaga, members of his family, significant places, and more. &lt;em&gt;Just Getting Started&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the relationship Tony has enjoyed with each one of these legends, entertainers, humanitarians, and loved ones, and reveals how the lessons and values they imparted have invaluably shaped his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enchanting and unforgettable as his music, &lt;em&gt;Just Getting Started&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful compilation of reflections every Bennett fan will treasure, and a perfect introduction for those just getting to know this remarkable star and humanitarian.&lt;/p&gt;" />
