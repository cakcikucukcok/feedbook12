  <title>Dig If You Will the Picture - Ben Greenman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named one of the best music books of 2017 by &lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A unique and kaleidoscopic look into the life, legacy, and electricity of the pop legend Prince and his wideranging impact on our culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Greenman, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author, contributing writer to the &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, and owner of thousands of recordings of Prince and Prince-related songs, knows intimately that there has never been a rock star as vibrant, mercurial, willfully contrary, experimental, or prolific as Prince. Uniting a diverse audience while remaining singularly himself, Prince was a tireless artist, a musical virtuoso and chameleon, and a pop-culture prophet who shattered traditional ideas of race and gender, rewrote the rules of identity, and redefined the role of sex in pop music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A polymath in his own right who collaborated with George Clinton and Questlove on their celebrated memoirs, Greenman has been listening to and writing about Prince since the mid-eighties. Here, with the passion of an obsessive fan and the skills of a critic, journalist, and novelist, he mines his encyclopedic knowledge of Prince&#39;s music to tell both his story and the story of the paradigm-shifting ideas that he communicated to his millions of fans around the world.  Greenman&#39;s take on Prince is the autobiography of a generation and its ideas. Asking a series of questions--not only &quot;Who was Prince?&quot; but &quot;Who wasn&#39;t he?&quot; and &quot;Who are &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Dig if You Will the Picture&lt;/i&gt; is a fitting tribute to an extraordinary talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
