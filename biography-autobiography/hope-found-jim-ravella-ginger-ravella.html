  <title>Hope Found - Jim Ravella, Ginger Ravella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written to those who are struggling to find their way out of total darkness hoping to see a sliver of light. To those who feel God is silent and long to hear His whisper, you are not alone. His presence may be faint and dim, but we promise He is there and you will find Him waiting to meet you in places you never thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginger Gilbert Ravella and Jim Ravella have served and sacrificed much for our country. Jim and Ginger&#39;s story of loss and tragedy turned to light and triumph, and the coming together of these two military families, inspires me. I do not take my freedom for granted nor the families like the Gilbert Ravella&#39;s who sacrifice for it. This family has taken their loss and turned it to the greater good. An uplifting story of love and faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Gary Sinise, Actor, Director, Musician, Veterans Advocate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and Founder, Gary Sinise Foundation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Hope Found, Ginger and Jim share their deeply personal experiences with love, loss and faith. Through journal entries and bible verses, you will come away knowing the depth of their pain and love for each other and the spouses they lost, as well as understand how faith helped them navigate a future they never anticipated.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Taya Kyle, Mother and New York Times &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bestselling Author of American Wife&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ginger, Jim and their children epitomize American heroes to me. Family and faith are woven throughout this book. The common bond of music, Troys old truck and love for our country have forever connected me to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Lee Brice, Award Winning Country &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music Recording Artist, Songwriter, Musician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of Jim and Ginger Ravella is riveting, inspirational and full of hope. Not only will the lives of all who read this be encouraged but this is a story for every church and city across our nation!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
