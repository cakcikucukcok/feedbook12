  <title>791 Coney Island Avenue: Brooklyn - George DiGuido</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;A kid of Italian immigrants grows up in South Brooklyn and Flatbush during the 20s, 30s, and 40s, playing Johnny-on-the-Pony, Ringalevio and Spin-the-Bottle.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;Life was simpler then, before the breakup of Ma Bell, the corporate takeovers, and junk mail. His generation was deeply affected by the Great depression; the Big Band music of Goodman, Dorsey, Ellington; movies of Cowboy and Indians, Fred and Ginger; Mickey and Judy; the New York Worlds Fair; and Pearl Harbor, which forced them to leave home and go to war in places they could hardly find on a map.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;REVIEW&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What great fun!  Ive never been to Brooklyn, and I feel I know the old 
place - and love it.  Although those simple, innocent, carefree, halcyon 
pre-war days of 50, 60, 70  years ago are long gone, they surely come alive in this 
charming, laugh-out-loud poignant memoir of Brooklyn.  DGuido writes as if 
hes talking to his reader over a beer, making the story both appealing and very 
accessible - a la Neil Simon, in tone and the story itself.&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Thanks to the author for recapturing a kinder, sweeter, gentler time with 
such wonderful recall.  Id love to send this book to several former 
Brooklyn-ite friends.  I cant imagine anyyone from  that era or place whod not enjoy 
this breezy, good read.&lt;/P&gt;" />
