  <title>My Lonely Existence - A True Story - Susanna Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone has a story to tell. Everyone has their own demons to deal with as they take their chosen path through life. Everyone has obstacles to overcome. However, some have more stories and more mountains to climb than others. This is a story about overcoming those mountains and making it to the other side. My Lonely Existence is the life story of Susanna, taking the reader through her life experiences and the myriad of relationships that she has had during the course of her lifetime. Some have been good, some have been bad but all have helped to make her the woman she is today. Having suffered abuse and trauma at the hands of a succession of family members and partners from a very young age until she was into her 30s, Susanna wanted to tell the world her story. And what a story it is!" />
