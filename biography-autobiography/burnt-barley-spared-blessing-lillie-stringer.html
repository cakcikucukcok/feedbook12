      <meta name="description" content="In this thoughtful book, Lillie Stringer describes the poignant agony she felt after the death of her son.  During this time, God gave her a personal message that was the key to unlocking a ministry to other grieving parents.  I burnt the barley, but I spared the blessing was a cloudy message that was clearly revealed in Gods time.  Yes, the barley was burnedher son was gone, but God promised a blessing in spite of this tragedy.  Lillies is a message of inspiration and compassion for those who mourn. The emotional scars that this kind of experience can impose upon parents who bury their children can subject them to empty, futile attempts to seek solace in the wrong places. Her desire is that God will diminish sorrows and fully equip those who mourn for recovery by giving a new and living hope.  This hope has already been signed, sealed, and delivered by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  This book contains a collection of letters and personal insights in which Lillie shares divine comfort with those who mourn." />
