  <title>My Elusive Mychele - Ken Strong, Tim Stiffler, Bob List</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Motivated by multiple jobs, extensive commitments, and huge ambitions, Ken Strong had little time for anything else. But when by chance he met a beautiful stranger, she was soon all he could think about. She was unlike any girl hed ever met with eyes that radiated her inner beauty as much as her outer beauty. His first love soon blossomed into something beyond his wildest dreams. But the busyness of life caught up and reality struck. Could his first love withstand the test of time and distance? Could this love be his forever love? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Elusive Mychele is an emotionally driven tale of first love that asks the question, &quot;If it is true love and if that person is your soul-mate, then is it possible to move on and to find that kind of love ever again?&quot; It is a powerful and sometimes painfully honest memoir that delves deep into that feeling of first love and just how elusive it can be." />
