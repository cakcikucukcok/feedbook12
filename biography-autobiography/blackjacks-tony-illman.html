  <title>Blackjacks - Tony Illman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is based on our lives. It starts very briefly in the United Kingdom and quickly moves to the Eastern Highland of Rhodesia. It moves through our childhood while were living in the eastern border areas, Umtali, Sabi Tanganda, and Chipinga. As we pass through our teenage years and become adults, it travels with us to Western Australia and then back to Chipinga. We share the lives of others as the Rhodesian Bush War escalates in what was a quiet and idyllic country town to one of the most dangerous and deadly districts in Rhodesia. 
Then the books deals with our final move back to Western Australia and our struggle to once again build a life for our children and ourselves. To most people, this may seem to be an unusual life, but to a Rhodesian, it would be considered pretty much the same story as many other families. Although it is our story, there are many stories told by others who have shared our way of life. It is about love, hate, and humor. It is about determination and desperation. It is about life and death and friendship and community spirit. Most of all, I hope it is a monument to those who died or were seriously injured, physically or mentally, black or white. It is also a salute to those incredible farmers, the Rhodesian armed forces, and those who worked in the rural areas during those troubled times. For me personally, writing this book has been a huge emotional journey." />
