  <title>Thirty Nine and Letting Go - John B. Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty Nine and Letting Go: A Father&#39;s Journey through a Son&#39;s Addiction and Depression shares the difficult journey of a father who faced a parent&#39;s worst-case tragedy: the loss of a child. John B. Jenkins, a Christian minister, presents the story of his son&#39;s addiction, depression, and eventual death. John felt inspired by the Lord to write this book while his son, Josh, was in a coma after his automobile accident in June 2016. He knew he needed to start writing the day after his son&#39;s funeral. It is his hope and prayer that others can find comfort and encouragement as they read the experiences he chronicles of Josh&#39;s journey through his depression, his addiction, and his untimely death. As a minister, he hopes to show how the love and mercy of God is truly unending, and his grace is most certainly all-sufficient. A father&#39;s memoir recalls the life and accidental death of a son and points to the boundless love and mercy of God that overcomes even reality&#39;s most trying moments." />
