  <title>The Place of Knowing - Emma Lou Warner Thayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;An intriguing spiritual memoir from an unusual woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Centered on Thaynes near-death experience following a car accident when she was in her 60s, this autobiography&lt;br /&gt;contains thematic chapters that explore her changing beliefs about mortality through meditations on family, language and&lt;br /&gt;other daily concepts. As a Mormon grandmother, parts of Thaynes lifeher long marriage, religious devotion and large&lt;br /&gt;familyare seemingly typical for someone of her generation. However, Thayne is also a poet and writer, weaving many&lt;br /&gt;of her poems and other writings into the body of this work. Often, Thayne describes the two roles of homemaker and&lt;br /&gt;author as being at odds with one another, at least within her own mind. In addition to her active, fulfilling involvement in&lt;br /&gt;the Mormon Church, she characterizes her writing life as almost a personal struggle. In a major theme of the book,&lt;br /&gt;Thayne seeks to resolve the internal conflict she feels when torn between her vocation and her concerns about meeting&lt;br /&gt;outside expectations. Interestingly, she addresses this internal conflict by looking both into her Mormon heritage and out&lt;br /&gt;toward other spiritual traditions and lifestyles. Discussing her parents and grandparents, Thayne reveals their warmth and&lt;br /&gt;the absence of doctrinaire beliefs in her childhood home. Her description of everyday Mormonism could be compared&lt;br /&gt;to the womens Islam for Muslim writers like Fatima Mernissi and Leila Ahmed. However, in her search for&lt;br /&gt;enlightenment, Thayne isnt content merely focusing on previous generations of her own family. Instead, she visits&lt;br /&gt;healers, helps bring to light the work of artists with AIDS and recognizes many influences from outside her own&lt;br /&gt;community. As a result, shes a complex, evolving narrator, grappling slowly with her own expectations and the&lt;br /&gt;challenges of life. Her meditative, fluid narrative might not satisfy readers looking for an eventful, action-oriented story,&lt;br /&gt;but readers interested in the optimistic pursuit of spiritual development shouldnt miss this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle, inclusive ruminations sure to strike a chord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
