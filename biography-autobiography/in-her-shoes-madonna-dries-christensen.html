  <title>In Her Shoes - Madonna Dries Christensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Madonna Dries Christensens poignant memoir, In Her Shoes, is a superb model for the preservation of personal family memories. Anyone who wishes to record his or her own family history should read this book first. With precise writing and awe-inspiring photos, Madonna has created a cherished keepsake for her immediate family as well as for posterity. As she aptly states in this memorable memoir: We become who we are because of who we were; a culmination of the momentous and the minutiae.&lt;br /&gt;E. P. Ned Burke, author of seven novels &lt;br /&gt;and editor of Yesterdays Magazette &lt;br /&gt;and Writers Magazette&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beautiful collection of stories creates, piece-by-loving-piece, the picture of a life well and richly lived. Madonna turns something as small as her first sip of Coca-Cola into a sensual drama and a morality play! After you read the final story, about the death of her beloved mother, youll want to hug your loved ones to you and tell them you love them.&lt;br /&gt;Marshall Cook, an emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is the author of 30 books. He edits a free online newsletter for writers called Extra Innings (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcs.wisc.edu/lsa/writing/extrainnings&quot;&gt;www.dcs.wisc.edu/lsa/writing/extrainnings&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tender and skillful tribute to her mother by Madonna Dries Christensen will certainly be treasured by her extended family for its careful curation of dear family history. The rest of us will enjoy the lively stories and nod in recognition of characters who have their counterparts in our own families. With her thoughtful narration and gallery of old photos, the author hopes to inspire others to record family memories while there is time. Enjoy this collection and start your own!&lt;br /&gt;Becky Haigler, editor, Silver Boomer Books, &lt;br /&gt;and author of not so GRIMM: gentle fables and cautionary tales.&lt;/p&gt;" />
