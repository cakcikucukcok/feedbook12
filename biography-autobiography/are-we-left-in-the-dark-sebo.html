  <title>Are We Left in the Dark? - Sebo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a young man and his journey&#39;s with his painful life, in every step he takes.
As nobody is aware of this,  he psychologically has stress from being alive, the 32 year old man has  
endless thoughts about his pain that the God has done to him.  As each day that goes by,  he talks to God in his mind, Why, why, why?  This man has no time to waste, as he is always thinking for his future and this future is ultimately to be safe in his thoughts, as he journey&#39;s every day from the time he wakes to the time he sleeps, he waitstruths that are out there, and the mysteries that surround him on this earth and ultimately out there in space.  He can&#39;t wait in his mind just to be free and, as he walks this earth.  He encounters thoughts and dreams that are full of psychological stress and one thing he does is he carries all the weight on his shoulders, he knows that one that  he will find the truth to why the God has made him. But until then he will struggle in this life as a human being, walking step by step, the pain he endures in this life, it&#39;s a wonder that he still is alive, the silence he keeps, will always remain the same, like a battle of ships, so enjoy as the reader just how his mind operates.
Psychologically the order in his mind is there, but so much different too the persons around him, where ever he goes." />
