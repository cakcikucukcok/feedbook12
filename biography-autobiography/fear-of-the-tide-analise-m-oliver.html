  <title>Fear of the Tide - Analise M. Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1959, Fidel Castro became the new leader of Cuba after starting the Cuban Revolution and taking over by force. The US CIA, along with hundreds of Cuban antirevolutionists, opposed this new regime and, through covert operations, tried to stop him. David Fuentes Martinez joined the resistance in hopes to save his people from the hands of a communist.
Davids story shares some of the dramatic events and frightening situations that he was involved in before learning that his life was in danger. Shortly after the Bay of Pigs Invasion, his team was compromised, and many were killed. In fear of being captured, he went into hiding. As Fidel Castros men narrowed in on him, he had to flee, leaving his country that he loved behind forever.
Only a handful of rebels managed to escape. David Fuentes Martinez was one of them." />
