  <title>Never Good Enough . . . Until Now - Sharon Gardiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Never Good Enough Until Now, is a very poignant story. Sharon is an Australian author and in her book she has opened her heart to tell her story knowing that it will help others have a greater understanding of themselves. It was not until Sharon reached her fiftieth birthday that she realised her whole life had been a reflection of the beliefs she developed from the instability of her childhood. The book teaches the values of how important nurturing is and the vital role of parents to a childs welfare. I spent my life searching for the answers to the wrong question. I was asking How could I heal the pain from my childhood? When in reality I should have been asking, How can I change the beliefs I created during my childhood?. Sharon openly shares the many adversities that she experienced and how she survived them. She reflects on the lessons and mistakes that we all have made at different times of our lives. It is through her personal and professional experience as an emergency nurse and a former police officer that raise the questions that allow the reader to reflect and interact on their own self. There are a lot of striking passages that would greatly move the hearts and outlook of a reader.  This is a very personal book that will bring readers to smile, laugh and cry. Sharon is a life coach and wants to help people live the best lives they can." />
