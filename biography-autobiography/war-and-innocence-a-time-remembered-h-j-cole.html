  <title>War and Innocence: A Time Remembered - H. J. Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the clouds of war begin to form over Europe, a young Irish couple start their life together in Belfast . It was a time when innovations flourished in the name of progress. Men and women were quickly swept up in the fight for freedom - both in Europe, and at home in Ireland. War and Innocence follows the Cole Family as they struggle to survive in an ever-changing world infused with wars and economic disasters. As thousands leave to fight in The Great War, others remain behind and are caught up in Ireland&#39;s quest for self-rule. Many of those fighting in Europe never return, and when the conflict ends and Ireland&#39;s economy changes, the descendants of James Cole must make life changing decisions in order to survive. Two of the Cole siblings remain in Belfast while others seek a better life in Canada, unaware of the impending financial disasters lurking ahead.  As the economy of the world struggles, they face unimaginable hardships and loss brought on by the economic and military wars of the period." />
