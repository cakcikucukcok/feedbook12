  <title>Anybody Seen Dan Lovett? - Daniel J. Lovett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dan Lovett was an important part of Eyewitness News history.
Al Primo, founder of the original Eyewitness News at WABC-TV in 1968 in New York
Dan has always had a great passion for sports, and his knowledge comes crystal clear in this book. Plus, anybody with hair that good has to have something going just below it.
Ron Franklin, former lead college football broadcaster on ESPN
A mans man in the true sense of the word. He has the unmatched ability to put your mind into his story. A legendary storyteller; plus, he is a great friend and gentleman.
Dan Pastorini, former Houston Oilers quarterback
I tossed him out of my garage in gasoline alley at Indy, but felt bad about it because he was from my hometown. Dan came around and showed me he wanted to learn about racing. He is a great broadcaster and cares about my sport.
A. J. Foyt, first four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500
I knew when I first hired him he would be a great broadcaster on the radio. He could talk about the farm report and make it the most important story of the day.
Curt Brown, member of the Missouri Broadcasters Hall of Fame
Dan knows how to tell the story in this book. If you like sports, youll Lovett.
Sam Huff, hall of fame linebacker of the Giants and Redskins" />
