  <title>Kepler&#39;s Witch - James A. Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set against the backdrop of the witchcraft trial of his mother, this lively biography of Johannes Kepler &amp;#8211; &#39;the Protestant Galileo&#39; and 16th century mathematician and astronomer &amp;#8211; reveals the surprisingly spiritual nature of the quest of early modern science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the style of Dava Sobel&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Galileo&#39;s Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, Connor&#39;s book brings to life the tidal forces of Reformation, Counter&amp;#8211;Reformation, and social upheaval. Johannes Kepler, who discovered the three basic laws of planetary motion, was persecuted for his support of the Copernican system. After a neighbour accused his mother of witchcraft, Kepler quit his post as the Imperial mathematician to defend her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Connor tells Kepler&#39;s story as a pilgrimage, a spiritual journey into the modern world through war and disease and terrible injustice, a journey reflected in the evolution of Kepler&#39;s geometrical model of the cosmos into a musical model, harmony into greater harmony. The leitmotif of the witch trial adds a third dimension to Kepler&#39;s biography by setting his personal life within his own times. The acts of this trial, including Kepler&#39;s letters and the accounts of the witnesses, although published in their original German dialects, had never before been translated into English. Echoing some of Dava Sobel&#39;s work for &lt;em&gt;Galileo&#39;s Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, Connor has translated the witch trial documents into English. With a great respect for the history of these times and the life of this man, Connor&#39;s accessible story illuminates the life of Kepler, the man of science, but also Kepler, a man of uncommon faith and vision.&lt;/p&gt;" />
