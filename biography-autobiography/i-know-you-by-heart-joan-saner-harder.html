  <title>I Know You by Heart - Joan Saner Harder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joan Saner Harder became captivated by a pair of blue eyes and a wink at the age of fifteen. Will was the new boy at the small community high school they attended in Kansas. The quality of his character captured her heart. From the first moment their eyes met, their love grew into an unbreakable bond that would last until the end of time. This writing grew out of the journals she kept during her deepest sorrow of losing him, the greatest love shed ever known. From the day she found herself alone for the first time in her life, she discovered that writing about their journey together was therapeutic. To Joan, Will was her hero, her dearest friend, and the love of her life. Her desire is to bestow honor to this man, well deserved.
He remains highly esteemed by the many lives he touched. This tender profile of a man who lived life to its fullest offers inspiration and guidance to a wide audience." />
