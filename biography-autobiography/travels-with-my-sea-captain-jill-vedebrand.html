  <title>Travels with My Sea Captain - Jill Vedebrand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;FROM HOLLYWOOD TO THE HIGH SEAS
&lt;P&gt;A chance encounter in Los Angeles airport with a Swedish Sea Captain and Jill left the movie business and was swept out to sea. From the glamour of Hollywood to life on board a rough cargo ship to playing Mother Goose on a remote Scottish farm, TRAVELS WITH MY SEA CAPTAIN is full of stories about the Captain and his international crew of characters, the many ports as Jill found herself travelling all over the world, life in the glen and how love can really change everything.
&lt;hr&gt;
REVIEWS:
&lt;P&gt;Travels With My Sea Captain by Jill Vedebrand
&lt;P&gt;A warm, humorous account of one woman&#39;s tempestuous affair and marriage to a fiery Swedish sea captain.  After meeting by chance in Los Angeles airport, Jill and Tomas fell in love and she decided to join him on some of his voyages to exotic locations including Japan, Singapore, Cuba, South America, India and Russia.
&lt;P&gt;There is no shortage of drama as she paints a vivid picture of months spent aboard a ship where she was often the only female.  At times resented by the crew, she also often adopted the role of agony aunt and compassionately recounts the hardship endured by men who can spend several years away from their families.  There are stories of drunken cooks, surly engineers, brutal fights, macho wrestling competitions, and frantic shore searches for men who had gone missing in the local brothels.  The physical aspect of being on board ship also poses problems as she struggles to adapt to the confined spaces, isolation of the open ocean and the violent weather they encounter.
&lt;P&gt;The often stunning and sometimes frightening places she visited during her time at sea are colourfully portrayed and she has a knack for bringing to life the sights, smells and atmosphere.
&lt;P&gt;Intertwined with the tales of her sea voyages are stories of Jill and Tomas&#39; home life in rural Scotland.  They buy a farm and there are accounts of their battles to restore the property and about their menagerie of ducks and pets.  In these parts the story reminded me a little of James Herriot or Lillian Beckwith&#39;s stories about life in the Hebrides and I think it would have great appeal to these markets.
&lt;P&gt;Part travelogue, part humorous account of life in the wilds of Scotland, this is an engaging, romantic, very human story.
