  <title>Riding High - Ruth Zukerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the co-founder of Flywheel and SoulCycle comes a story of perseverance and success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ruth Zukerman is an inspiration. She somehow had a keen sense that indoor cycling was going to be a huge trend and she wasted no time turning it into a lucrative business. I&#39;m among the legions of Flywheel fans who make Ruth&#39;s class part of our regular routine. Her energy, enthusiasm and great playlist keeps us spinning and coming back for more.&quot; --KATIE COURIC&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ruth Zukerman is the Queen of Spinning: she put the Soul in SoulCycle and the Fly in Flywheel.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recounting the pivotal moments that helped launch Zukerman as the breakout star of the boutique fitness world, &lt;i&gt;Riding High &lt;/i&gt;is a reminder that the greatest success stories often start in the unlikeliest of places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruth Zukerman used her heartache-at the death of her father, the end of her marriage, and the dissolution of her first business partnership with SoulCycle, as the inspiration to reinvent herself. At 51, she co-founded a new business, the highly successful Flywheel, and built the life she&#39;d always dreamed of. And she did it all while navigating through single motherhood and a business world that is often unkind to women, especially those who wear their hearts on their sleeves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riding High&lt;/i&gt; is a prescriptive, warts-and-all journey through Ruth&#39;s evolution, offering fresh, unexpected business and life lessons to help readers recognize their own potential and channel their passion into success. Part confidante, part mentor, Ruth pulls no punches and holds nothing back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
