  <title>Fat Chick Goes AWOL: 2,600 Miles in an Armchair on Wheels (with a 600-Mile Detour on Foot) - ANNA MITCHELL</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAT CHICK PLANS TO ESCAPE CORPORATE WHOREDOM AND TRAVEL THE WORLD. SHE&amp;rsquo;S JUST BOUGHT A RECUMBENT TRIKE TO DO IT WITH. BUT WITH SO MUCH GOING AGAINST HER, WILL SHE EVEN MAKE IT OUT OF THE CITY?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fat Chick is a 30-something accountant who dreams of cycling, hiking and paddling her way around the world, starting with her own country, Australia. But at a whopping 130kgs (285lbs), she&amp;rsquo;s not exactly the poster child for human-powered travel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On top of that, nobody will let her leave the Real World. The armchair experts won&amp;rsquo;t stop filling her head with dire predictions of being chopped up by axe murderers, run over by road trains and eaten by crocodiles. Her new personal trainer is trying to kill her with diet and exercise. And her boss just hired a hit woman to destroy Fat Chick&amp;rsquo;s trike because the accounting system needs to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Fat Chick is determined to steer her life in the direction of her dreams, not the dreams of others, because &amp;lsquo;life is short, and it&amp;rsquo;s later than you think&amp;rsquo;. But the Real World is determined to keep her in its grip. Can she break free of the spider&amp;rsquo;s web and live her dreams before it&amp;rsquo;s too late?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
