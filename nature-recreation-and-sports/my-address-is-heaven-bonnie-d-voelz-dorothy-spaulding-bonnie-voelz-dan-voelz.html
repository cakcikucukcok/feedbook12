  <title>My Address Is Heaven - Bonnie D. Voelz, Dorothy Spaulding, Bonnie Voelz, Dan Voelz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bill Linderman was as good of a three event contestant as ever signed an entry form. Go back through the records and see how many times he won the all-around at Calgary, Cheyenne, and Pendleton and so many more.
His ability to cowboy and beat the best in the world during his career is truly a small part of this mans success. He was a leader among men and really played an important part in the pioneering of our organization. Bill was President of The Rodeo Cowboys Association at a time when it could have easily succumbed to the International Rodeo Association which was made up of committeemen from Calgary, Pendleton, Ellensburg, and the Cow Palace in San Francisco, Denver, Cheyenne, and so many more of the big rodeos. Not many will remember how staunch he really was in this period of preservation and growth of our sport as we know it today." />
