  <title>Book 7: 101 Sports Coaching Snippets - Bert Holcroft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="101 Sports Coaching Snippets is an e-book of formulations plus illustrations plus innovations to senior professionals technical and scientific proficiencies, skills, and drills with elite fitness formats up to Microsoft-ergonomic specifications converted to easy-to-read and implement test charts to achieve an elite sports accreditation. It should inspire the reader to purchase more of the six fully illustrated e-books/coaching manuals to achieve a successful conclusion.
Most publishers leave a huge vacuum in books on achievement to posses a qualified accredited certificate of the sport of their choice, filling the dream of one day representing the school, university, college, town, county, and country of their birth at international accreditation to a successful conclusion. Our enclosed coaching accreditations are valid worldwide as a professional international accreditation.
Our books are fully illustrated to suit any person from underage and junior to professional levels of application of the sport of their choice. This includes all genders, which makes our e-book the only e-book published with a fully accredited sports coaching and fitness certificate enclosed!
These are the only books ever published that have charts, skills, and drills to implement a coaching seminar and award the participants with an official coaching accreditation. These accreditations cost applicants up to six hundred pounds to attend an official seven days coaching seminar." />
