First and foremost, it is important to understanding that there is no winning system that can beat the mathematical odds that the casino has against a player.  However, this book teaches you strategies to follow while in the casino, giving you a large amount of information to help you walk out a winner.  These tips can benefit players of all experience levels.  You will learn to think how the casino thinks, and avoid the traps they set for every player.

This book makes the game and strategy information easy to understand and follow, as well as fun and enjoyable to read, with a bit of irreverant humor sprinkled throughout." />
