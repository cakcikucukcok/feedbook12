  <title>Drawing Farm and Zoo Animals - Raymond Sheppard, Charles  Frederick Tunnicliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For the first time in a single-volume edition, this guide combines the works of two of Britain&#39;s leading&amp;nbsp; 20th-century illustrators of animals,&amp;nbsp;Raymond Sheppard&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Drawing at the Zoo&lt;/I&gt; and Charles Tunnicliffe&#39;s &lt;I&gt;How to Draw Farm Animals.&lt;/I&gt;&amp;nbsp;Artists of all skill levels will benefit from the book&#39;s tremendous variety of domestic and wild animal studies, each accompanied by helpful pointers.&lt;BR&gt;Even the smallest of zoos offers models with an abundant variety of shapes and patterns. It&#39;s not always easy to capture animals in motion, so in &lt;I&gt;Drawing at the Zoo,&lt;/I&gt; Raymond Sheppard proposes starting with sleeping creatures and the less excitable types to help overcome the practical difficulties. Other suggestions include what &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt; to do, notes on distinctive animal characteristics, and a survey of basic shapes, all illustrated by the author&#39;s own work. Charles F. Tunnicliffe, author of &lt;I&gt;How to Draw Farm Animals,&lt;/I&gt; grew up on a farm and drew and painted animals all his life. In addition to dozens of fascinating examples of his sketches, his book includes informative comments on farm life that provide essential tips for the realistic portrayals of horses, cattle, pigs, and sheep as well as the farmer&#39;s dog and the farmyard cat." />
