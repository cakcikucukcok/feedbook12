  <title>Golf My Own Damn Way: The Wit and Wisdom of John Daly - John Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you know anything at all about John Daly&amp;#8212;and if you don&#39;t, what in the hell are you doing with this book in your hands?&amp;#8212;you know he approaches the game of golf from an, uh, slightly different perspective than your average two-time major winner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How different? Well, for starters, Long John thinks the PGA Tour ought to permit Bermuda shorts, make carts mandatory, let him wear his hair down to his butt if he wants to, and strip-search tournament patrons at the entrance gate to keep cameras and cell phones off the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Golf My Own Damn Way&lt;/em&gt;, you&#39;ll take a virtual ride on Big John&#39;s magic bus as he tells you the best way to grip it so you can rip it. Looking for a sure cure to bunkerphobia? It&#39;s here. A one-hour golf lesson that&#39;s 100 percent guaranteed to make you a better golfer? Ditto. Want to know why you should occasionally leave your big dog in your trunk, how to watch your weight, and what golf and sex have in common? You came to the right book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while he&#39;s busy explaining all these and many other things, Daly also tells you why you should keep your head out of the game, let your belly lead your hands, listen to your right foot, check your ball position&amp;#8212;and buy a hybrid (the club, not the car).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following in the spike prints of his 2006 bestselling autobiography, &lt;em&gt;My Life In and Out of the Rough&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Golf My Own Damn Way&lt;/em&gt; is an off-the-wall and intensely personal yet imminently practical and accessible tip sheet on how to cut ten strokes off your score&amp;#8212;now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things are certain: you&#39;ve never seen a golf instructional book quite like this one, and you&#39;ll never need another one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fairways and greens, Pard!&lt;/p&gt;" />
