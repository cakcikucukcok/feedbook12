  <title>Henry Cooper - Norman Giller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;When Sir Henry Cooper died in May 2011, the depth of affection in the tributes was a testament to his remarkable popularity. Put simply, Henry Cooper was the nation&amp;amp;#8217;s favourite boxer: a gentleman and a great sportsman of whom Muhammad Ali &amp;amp;#150; famously floored by Enery&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;#8217;Ammer in 1963 &amp;amp;#150; remarked, &amp;amp;#145;Henry Cooper hit me so hard my ancestors in Africa felt it.&amp;amp;#8217; Sir Henry&amp;amp;#8217;s popularity transcended boxing and he became an even bigger national hero in the years after his retirement from the ring in 1971, raising millions of pounds for charity with unstinting efforts recognised and rewarded with a knighthood. During his fighting career he was the only boxer to win three Lonsdale Belts outright, was undefeated European and Empire champion and the British title-holder for more than eleven years. Originally planned as an autobiography, and written with the blessing of Henry&amp;amp;#8217;s two sons, A Hero for All Time is a well-informed and detailed biography that puts his life and extraordinary boxing career into fresh focus. It includes in-depth summaries of his major fights, with new commentaries from Henry himself. Featuring many previously untold stories about his boxing career, it paints an intimate portrait of a man whose courage, skill and sportsmanship lifted him into the land of sporting legend.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
