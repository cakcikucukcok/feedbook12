  <title>I&#39;m Fascinated by Sacrifice Flies - Tim Kurkjian, George F. Will</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Bestseller!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath of the Steroid Era that stained the game of baseball, at a time when so many players are so rich and therefore have a sense of entitlement that they haven&#39;t earned, ESPN baseball commentator Tim Kurkjian shows readers how to love the game more than ever, with incredible insight and stories that are hilarious, heartbreaking, and revealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what Pete Rose was doing in the batting cage a few minutes after getting out of prison, to why everyone strikes out these days and why no one seems to care, &lt;i&gt;I&#39;m Fascinated By Sacrifice Flies&lt;/i&gt; will surprise even longtime baseball fans. Tim explains the fear factor in the game, and what it feels like to get hit by a pitch; Adam LaRoche wanted to throw up in the batter&#39;s box. He examines the game&#39;s superstitions: Eliot Johnson&#39;s choice of bubble gum, a poker chip in Sean Burnett&#39;s back pocket. He unearths the unwritten rules of the game, takes readers inside ESPN, and reveals how Tony Gwynn made baseball so much more fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, Tim will explain to readers why he is fascinated by sacrifice flies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
