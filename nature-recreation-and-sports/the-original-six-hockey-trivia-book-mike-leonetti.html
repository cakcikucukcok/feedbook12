  <title>The Original Six Hockey Trivia Book - Mike Leonetti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Remember when it was just Montreal, Toronto, New York, Detroit, Boston and Chicago? Veteran hockey writer Mike Leonetti certainly does, and he’s got a brand new trivia book to prove it! &lt;em&gt;The Original Six Hockey Trivia Book&lt;/em&gt; challenges fans’ knowledge of the NHL’s most storied and glorious franchises. With more than 800 questions and answers—categorized by team and covering memorable games, records and awards, trades and outstanding players—the book also features more than 150 photos. And it’s not just for those old enough to remember when the NHL only included six teams: &lt;em&gt;The Original Six Hockey Trivia Book&lt;/em&gt; skates right into the 2006–2007 season with fascinating lore on the six teams that will stump even the most avid of fans. Here’s what you can expect: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detroit Red Wings: Gordie Howe broke Maurice Richard’s all-time goal-scoring record when he scored his 545th career goal on November 10, 1963, versus which opponent and what netminder?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Montreal Canadiens: Named head coach of the Canadiens for the 2006–2007 season, this former Hab was a three-time Stanley Cup winner (twice with Montreal, once with Dallas). Name him.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Toronto Maple Leafs: When Darryl Sittler had his 10-point night against Boston on February 7, 1976, one other Leaf player scored two goals and added two assists in the Leafs 11–4 victory. Who was this other high-scoring Leaf?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
