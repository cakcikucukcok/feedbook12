  <title>The Handy Dinosaur Answer Book - Patricia Barnes-Svarney, Thomas E Svarney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The mighty dinosaurs were the dominant life form on earth for millions of years. But catastrophe awaited. In what amounts to a geological blink of an eye, the dinosaurs disappeared. The Handy Dinosaur Answer Book, Second Edition takes you deep into the world of dinosaurs---a great ride through what is currently known (and being debated) about these creatures and their surroundings. It covers the latest, greatest findings along with the accompanying shifts in dinosaur theory. Because of recent discoveries, there are some great debates: are birds really dinosaurs?; were any warm blooded?; what caused their extinction? Unearth answers to over 600 commonly asked (and just plain interesting) dinosaur questions such as . . . How old is the Earth? What is a dinosaur? What were some of the problems as amphibians moved from water to land? What were the first true dinosaurs like? What were the stegosaurs? What were the tyrannosaurs? Where are extremely large dinosaur bones being found and why? Did some dinosaurs have self-sharpening teeth? What carnivore and herbivore dinosaurs were biggest? Which dinosaur had the longest neck of any animal known? Where and what is the Dinosaur Freeway? Did dinosaurs travel in herds? Did dinosaurs migrate? Did any dinosaurs climb or live in trees? How large was a dinosaur&amp;#8217;s brain? What were the major extinctions during the Earth&amp;#8217;s long history? Did dinosaurs get blown away by hurricanes? What groups survived the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period? What dinosaurs are thought to have evolved into birds? What famous dinosaur is nicknamed &amp;#147;Sue&amp;#8221;? What are some notable Tyrannosaurus rex found in the United States? How do paleontologists, or even amateur collectors, find dinosaur fossils? Do dinosaur bones ever get &amp;#147;rearranged&amp;#8221; after they are mounted?&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
