  <title>So you want to run an Ultra - Andy Mouncey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;So you want to run an Ultramarathon. It all looks a very long way, doesn&#39;t it? It can&#39;t be good for you, it can&#39;t be fun and surely you have to be some kind of super-athlete to be able to run that far? This book shows that it is a very long way, that it can be good for you, and that you most certainly don&#39;t have to be super-human to finish one. It also goes further by inspiring you to get started and by guiding you each step of the way. So, whether you&#39;re just curious to know more about this fast-growing global sport or searching for the right answers to your own ultra-running breakthrough, this book will prove as valuable as your favourite running shoes. Includes advice on making the transition from marathon or triathlon; strategies for winning the mental battle; keeping your feet intact; maintaining the right fuel intake; how to build strength and endurance and, finally, how to deal with running in the dark.Andy Mouncey writes from the heart, combining great insight and knowledge with a knack for making the complicated seem simple. Throw in a healthy dose of dry humour and case-study contributions from real people at various stages of their ultra-running journey and you have a book that redefines the &#39;How To&#39; style of sports training guide. Illustrated with 93 colour photographs.&lt;/div&gt;" />
