  <title>A Tanimbar Experience - Russ Swan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Delma had never really shown much inclination to sail in a cruising yacht outside the confines of Darwin Harbour. She viewed sailing out there with something akin to horror. So why did she suddenly suggest sailing across the Arafura Sea to a remote group of islands in the far-eastern region of Indonesia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story by the skipper of an eight-tonne, thirty-foot cruising yacht, describing an open-water voyage with four crew members, two of whom had absolutely no sailing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skippers view of the incidents and events from preparation until return back to Australia is laced with humour and delightfully describes the places they sail to, characters they meet, local cultures, and a little history of the region. The experience of enduring a heavy storm at sea should not be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charts allow the reader to follow the story closely. This book includes photographs, a comprehensive glossary of nautical terms, and cruising notes, as well as other useful information for seafarers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
