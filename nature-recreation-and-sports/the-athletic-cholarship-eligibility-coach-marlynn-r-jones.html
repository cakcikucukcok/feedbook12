  <title>The Athletic $Cholarship  Eligibility Coach - Marlynn R. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMPLEMENTING THE ELIGIBILITY COACHS GAME PLAN MAY SAVE YOU THOUSANDS!&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing one simple mistake can turn a scholarship celebration into a frantic search for $15,000-$60,000 to finance the first year of college, &lt;b&gt;Marlynn Jones&lt;/b&gt; serves as a personal coach through the maze of legislation involved in acquiring a college athletic scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eligibility Coach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; addresses the Top 21 Common Mistakes made during the Certification Process, and answers these important questions:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 What is Amateurism Certification?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 What core courses are required for Certification?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 How does the sliding scale work?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 How to transfer between schools and be eligible to compete?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
 Are there additional requirements for International Students? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eligibility Coach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; provides a much needed resource for athletic directors, coaches and counselors to use for student-athletes in preparing them for NCAA and NAIA eligibility certification. This coaching guide needs to be implemented sooner rather than later.&lt;br&gt;
Dr. Jason Pappas, Assistant Director of Athletics for Student-Athlete Services, Florida State University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eligibility Coach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; helped us understand NCAA regulations and timelines as well as prepared us for both official and home visits. We knew what to expect throughout the process, and what questions to ask. After considering offers in gymnastics from several Division I universities, our daughter accepted a full athletic scholarship and is a Deans List student competing for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She was recently admitted to medical school and received a 2012 Post-Graduate Scholarship Award from the Atlantic Coast Conference [ACC].&lt;br&gt;
Darrell and Tedra Brown, Gymnastics Parents in North Carolina&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a blueprint on how to transition from high school to college athletics, search no further. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eligibility Coach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is an easy-to-read how-to guide regarding athletic scholarships that every high school coach, athletic director, and parent must have.&lt;br&gt;
