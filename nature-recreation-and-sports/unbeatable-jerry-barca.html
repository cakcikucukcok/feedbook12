  <title>Unbeatable - Jerry Barca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best undefeated team in the history of college football--the dramatic true story of the 1988 Notre Dame Fighting Irish and their incredible unbeaten season&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to tell the complete story of the incredible 1988 season that brought the fledgling Fighting Irish back to the top of college sports in what many consider to be the greatest unbeaten season of college football ever played. With a completely unlikely but forever memorable cast of characters--including the slight, lisping coach Lou Holtz; the star quarterback, Tony Rice; five foot nothing Asian kicker, Reggie Ho; NFL-bound Ricky Watters; and a crazed and ferocious defensive line, among others--Notre Dame whipped millions of fans into a frenzy. This roller coaster season of football includes the infamous Catholics vs. Convicts game (Notre Dame vs. Jimmy Johnson&#39;s #1 ranked Miami Hurricanes). The two teams were undefeated when they met at Notre Dame Stadium, with the Irish winning in the final seconds by a final score of 31-30.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With original reporting and interviews with everyone from the players to the coaches, detailed research, and access to the Notre Dame archives, Jerry Barca tells a gripping story of an unbelievable season and the players who would become legends. More than a Notre Dame book, &lt;i&gt;Unbeatable&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling narrative of one of the most incredible sports stories of the last century--the unlikely tale of an underdog team coming together and making history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
