  <title>Pet Law and Custody - Barbara J. Gislason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Providing legal, scientific, social, and ethical information on how the law affects pets, this compelling and compassionate book is a useful resource for lawyers and for anyone interested in the welfare and legal rights of animals. Author Barbara J. Gislason takes an in-depth look at the complicated subject of pet custody disputes from many angles, and offers practical information on how ADR processes such as arbitration and mediation can be used in resolving these often-emotional conflicts.
Pet Law and Custody examines all legal issues involved with pets, from family law and divorce to estate planning and how property and tort law affect pet ownership. Beyond its clear explanation of legal topics, Gislason clarifies how scientific knowledge about the cognitive abilities and emotional characteristics of other animals should lead to legal developments. She also offers perceptive insights on how cultural perspectives, cognitive biases, and points of view impact negotiations, alternative dispute resolutions, and decision-making processes.
Topics include:
Family law and replevin actions
Alternative dispute resolution
Estate planning for animals
Contract law and the Uniform Commercial Code
Property law
Tort law affecting pet law
Animal cruelty
Dangerous dogs
Science and bioethics
Practical advice for the animal lawyer, including law office basics, handling a legal case, and identifying experts
Throughout the book, the author provides a generous supply of Practice Pointers drawn from her years of practice. A valuable supply of practice-ready appendices includes sample pleadings, agreements, rescue adoption contract, pet custody questionnaire, and more." />
