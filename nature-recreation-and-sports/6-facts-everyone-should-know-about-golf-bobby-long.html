  <title>6 Facts Everyone Should Know About Golf - Bobby Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To people who are new to the world of golf but, nevertheless, are intending to play the sport, one factor that they should focus on is the perfect golf swing. To mention some other factors, there are a lot such as, the golf equipment, the direction of the wind, the golf ball and the player himself, but still, the precision of the swing is the causal factor on the success or flop of playing golf.   In the game of golf, no two people ever have the same golf swing. Each person has their own individual body with its own strengths, flexibility and range of motion. The way one person swings a golf club may not work for another person, even if they are near in body types. Every golfer has to find the playing style that fits them to help them produce the results that they want. Players that know what is going to happen to the ball when they hit it, and what factors affect that moment of impact can effectively use their body to create the consistent powerful golf swing that they desire.
