  <title>The Canine Strategies Workbook : For People Who Love Their High - Energy, Fearful, Willful and / or Reactive Dogs - Eric Michael Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Am I solving the right problem the right way?&quot;  So many trainers tell us what to do based on what they believe is &quot;best&quot;, without customizing to the dog, the owner, the family and the situation. What we &quot;should&quot; do is not always the same as what we are willing to do, what we are capable of doing, or what will be effective with our dog and our family.  The Canine Strategies Workbook is less of a &quot;dog training book&quot; and more of a psychological and behavioral troubleshooting guide. Its goal is to provide an understanding of what is happening, coupled with real-world options in ways that work for you.   The strategies in the workbook may be especially helpful with dogs that have been rescued or re-homed from shelters or foster situations. Often, it is impossible to know what the dog has experienced earlier in life, but being able to recognize and possibly reprogram the situations that cause the dog to experience stress may be able to greatly improve the experiences and relationship for dog and owner." />
