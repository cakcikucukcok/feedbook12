  <title>Alps Mountain Biking - Steve Mallett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alps Mountain Biking is a guide to the western Alps. It reveals epic rocky descents, high-altitude blasts and hidden Alpine singletrack, all set against a backdrop of snowy peaks, pine forests and clear blue skies. This is some of the greatest singletrack, enduro and downhill riding the mountains have to offer. Featuring the Alpine hot spots alongside the best lesser-known areas, you can ride the main lines of Morzine and Chamonix, and then escape the crowds and head to La Plagne, Martigny or Sauze d&#39;Oulx. Using lifts, buses and good old pedal power, you can really exploit the massive vertical gains each area has to offer and enjoy trails that cater for every taste and ability. Alps Mountain Biking has everything you need to get out of the concrete resorts and plan a great riding trip. Written by Samoëns-based guide Steve Mallett, it gives you the local riders&#39; inside knowledge on trails, and information on accommodation, lifts and travel. Packed with fantastic photography, it is guaranteed to inspire you to get out and explore this huge mountain bike playground." />
