  <title>Seahorses as Pets.  Seahorse Complete Owners Manual. Seahorse care, health, tank, costs and feeding. - Edward Eldington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The seahorse is an amazing fish that is a wonderful aquarium inhabitant despite the fact that they are not as easy to care for as most fish. There are approximately 52 species to delight the aquarist and they can be kept on their own or with other fish and certain invertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will introduce you to these fish by looking at the different species, discussing their appearance and biology, typical seahorse behaviour, their feeding requirements, one-of-a-kind reproductive cycle and other things that make these fish unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also tell you what you need to know in order to decide whether or not this is the pet for you and, if it is, how to select your seahorse, what you need to buy before you bring it home, and how to take proper care of it and keep it happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The serious hobbyist must know what these fish need with regards to their environment. All the necessary equipment and water and other parameters are examined as the quality of the water and the general environment has a crucial bearing on the health and happiness of seahorses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seahorse is unfortunately susceptible to a number of different types of bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections and infestations. Anyone who is serious about having a marine tank generally and seahorses specifically needs to know what to look for and how to deal with common ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book also contains helpful information on their reproductive behaviour, gestation, birth and on caring for the fry for those who are interested in breeding or find themselves the proud foster parent of babies that were not expected!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other areas of discussion are the fish and invertebrates that the seahorse gets on with and hints and tips to make your life easier as you select your seahorse and afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered in this book:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Do&amp;rsquo;s and Don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The basics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Choosing the right fish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Social behaviour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Buying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Equipment needed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Setting up the aquarium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Water &amp;amp; other parameters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Introduction to other creatures into the tank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Daily care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Feeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Breeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Prices and costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;..... and much more&lt;/p&gt;" />
