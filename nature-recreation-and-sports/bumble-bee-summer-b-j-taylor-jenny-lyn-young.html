  <title>Bumble Bee Summer - B. J. Taylor, Jenny Lyn Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells about two sisters, Paityn and Paxtyn visiting their grandparents on the farm during summer vacation.  Grandad tells them a pleasant story based on true information about how Mrs. Queen Bumblebee struggles to protect her babies, just as any parent would, during three episodes of danger.  There was danger to the queen bumble bee, to the bumble bee nest and to the bumble bee babies.  It tells how the worker bees worked at keeping their pollen baskets full to feed the babies when they arrived, while Mrs. Bee fanned, pampered and protected the nest.  Mrs. Bee emphasizes how important it was for her to protect them from the elements, and ever present enemies, since they had such an important task of pollinating the farmer&#39;s crops.  Otherwise, without their help, the children of the world would have no food to eat." />
