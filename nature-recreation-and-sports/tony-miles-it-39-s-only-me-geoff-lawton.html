  <title>Tony Miles: It&#39;s Only Me - Geoff Lawton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The charismatic Tony Miles has been much missed since his tragic and premature death in 2001. Regarded as one of England&#39;s greatest ever chess players and analysts, he was also one of the wittiest writers on the game. By sheer force of example and ebullient peronality, he inspired the &#39;English chess explosion&#39; after becoming the first UK grandmaster in the mid 70s. This Fascinating collection of over a hundred games and articles, covering Tony&#39;s entire chess career, includes his most celebrated wins, a few losses, and in addition to the famous game against Karpov with the bizarre St George&#39;s opening 1 e4 a6 - a less well known victory over the then world champion from a television tournament. All the games are annotated by Tony himself - in his own inimitable style. This fitting tribute is rounded off with a review of Tony&#39;s original opening repertoire as well as personal appreciations by his Birmingham clubmates and friends Mike Fox, Malcolm Hunt and Geoff Lawton.&lt;/div&gt;" />
