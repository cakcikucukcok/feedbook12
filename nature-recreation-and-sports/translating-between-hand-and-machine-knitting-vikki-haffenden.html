  <title>Translating Between Hand and Machine Knitting - Vikki Haffenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Knitting is an enduringly popular and creative craft, but many associate the techniques primarily with hand knitting, believing machine knitting to require arcane knowledge.  However, machine knitting is formed from the same stitch structures and is equally versatile.  Translating between Hand and Machine Knitting rediscovers the potential of domestic machine knitting to open up new possibilities for dedicated knitters, offering an equally creative yet timesaving method of crafting new designs.  With over 500 images, this comprehensive guide offers detailed step-by-step explanations of techniques in both hand and machine knitting, whilst also offering inspiration and design advice.  Dr Vikki Haffenden, a highly experienced knit designer, technical knitter and educator, shares the knowledge and understanding she has accumulated over a career designing for the knitted textile and knitwear industry and as a lecturer in knitted textile design. Topics covered include: Illustrated step-by-step instructions of hand and machine knitting techniques; Qualities and behaviours of fibres and yarns and their suitability for knitting; Equipment requirements and advice; Basic stitches and stitch constructions of hand and machine knitting; Combining stitches to make surface texture and colour patterns; Shaping and knitting 3D shapes; Calculating garment shape and size from tension swatches. Superbly illsutrated with 397 colour photographs and 130 line artworks." />
