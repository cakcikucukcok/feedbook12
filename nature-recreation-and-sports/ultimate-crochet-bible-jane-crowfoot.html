  <title>Ultimate Crochet Bible - Jane Crowfoot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ultimate Crochet Bible is a definitive reference for all aspects of crochet – from the first chain to the care and maintenance of your projects. The first two chapters are packed with useful information such as choosing and using a hook, how to read a pattern, holding the yarn and basic stitches. Once you are armed with the basics, you can go on to learn about a wide range of techniques. Traditional, lace-weight crochet is covered in the Thread Crochet section. The yarn used tends to be fine and the hooks are small, but this allows you to put more detail into a piece of work. Filet and Irish crochet are covered here. The section on Tunisian and Entrelac Crochet shows how elements of crochet and knitting can be combined. Entrelac is a method of creating square shapes in order to make a textured fabric that resembles basket weave. 
In Working with Colour, the two main techniques of adding colour to a piece of crochet – Intarsia and Jacquard – are explained. And to create some really exciting effects, you can add beads and sequins to your crochet. It’s a relatively easy technique. In addition, there are techniques for edgings, braids, fringes and tassels. Professional Finishing Techniques provides all the know-how you need to take your crochet to a whole new level. But whatever your level of experience, this book will be an invaluable treasure trove of crochet techniques that you will turn to time and time again." />
