      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Riding Home:The Power of Horses to Heal, &lt;/i&gt;Horse Nation&#39;s must read book of 2016, is the first and only book to scientifically and experientially explain why horses have the extraordinary ability to emotionally transform the lives of thousands of men, women and children, whether they are horse lovers, or suffering from deep psychological wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a book for anyone who wants to experience the joy, wonder, self-awareness and peace of mind that comes from creating a horse/human relationship, and it puts forth and clarifies the principles of today&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Natural Horsemanship&lt;/i&gt; (or what was once referred to as &lt;i&gt;&quot;Horse Whispering&quot;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone knows someone who needs help: a husband, a wife, a partner, a child, a friend, a troubled teenager, a war veteran with PTSD, someone with autism, an addiction,  anyone in emotional pain or who has lost their way. &lt;i&gt;Riding Home &lt;/i&gt;provides riveting examples of how Equine Therapy has become one of today&#39;s most effective cutting-edge methods of healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horses help us discover hidden parts of ourselves, whether we&#39;re seven or seventy. They model relationships that demonstrate acceptance, kindness, honesty, tolerance, patience, justice, compassion, and forgiveness. Horses cause all of us to become better people, better parents, better partners, and better friends.&lt;br&gt;A horse can be our greatest teacher, for horses have no egos, they never lie, they&#39;re never wrong and they manifest unparalleled compassion. It is this amazing power of horses to heal and teach us about ourselves that is accessible to anyone and found in the pages of Tim Hayes&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Riding Home.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information and lists of therapeutic and non-therapeutic equine programs, which are contained in the book, are also available at the book&#39;s website.&lt;/p&gt;" />
