  <title>Play Blackjack Like the Pros - Kevin Blackwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Professional blackjack player Kevin Blackwood shares his million-dollar winning strategies for mastering the odds and consistently beating the house at their own game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Play Blackjack Like the Pros&lt;/em&gt; is the requisite introduction to the modern game of blackjack, including high and low stakes casino, shoe games (several decks shuffled together), online, and tournaments. Blackwood begins with the basic rules of play and then moves on to teach his proven card-counting method, broken-down into three levels: novice, recreational, and professional. He also covers camouflaging techniques (it&#39;s perfectly legal to count cards, but if the house catches you they will kick you out), money management, and team play. Blackwood includes many stories of his and other professionals&#39; triumphs at the tables and keeps the highly technical language that bogs down most gaming books to an absolute minimum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Play Blackjack Like the Pros&lt;/em&gt; is written in the style of Phil Hellmuth&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Play Poker Like the Pros&lt;/em&gt; using easy-to-understand lessons that all levels of players can quickly benefit from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blackwood is one of the world&#39;s top card counters. He began with only a few hundred dollars and has won over a million playing blackjack. In &lt;em&gt;Play Blackjack Like the Pros&lt;/em&gt; he demonstrates how to earn over $10,000 a month from just a few days work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blackjack is set to balloon in popularity. Ben Mezrich&#39;s book on the MIT card counting team &lt;em&gt;Bringing Down the House&lt;/em&gt; was on the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller list for weeks and is being made into a movie staring Kevin Spacey. Blackjack Tournaments are growing in popularity with many of the top casinos offering large prize pools. Online Blackjack is currently a multi-million dollar industry.  Blackwood keeps the highly technical language that bogs down most gaming books to an absolute minimum.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foreword by Stanford Wong, author of &lt;em&gt;Professional Blackjack&lt;/em&gt; and the master of modern card counting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
