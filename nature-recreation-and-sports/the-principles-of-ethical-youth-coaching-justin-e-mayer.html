  <title>The Principles of Ethical Youth Coaching - Justin E. Mayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coaches:
Would you like to coach your players in an ethical environment where you are
developing the character of your players while sti ll being competi ti ve?
Parents:
Would you like your son or daughter coached in a safe environment where
they will be able to develop life skills that will maximize their performance in
areas outside of sports like educati on?
The Principles of Ethical Youth Coaching provides the answers!
The reality of sports is that very few athletes ever make it to the highest level of
a given sport. Yet the training resources off ered to youth coaches focus almost
exclusively on strategies to promote winning. The techniques advocated by
these training programs may be acceptable for professional athletes; however,
they are not acceptable for youth athletes. The overwhelming focus on winning
causes coaches to miss opportuniti es to promote character development skills
in their players. When, if at all, ethical player development skills are brought
up in these programs, it is done so in passing and no concrete strategies are
off ered. On the other hand, some well-intenti oned programs seek to eliminate
winning from the equati on. This is not a realisti c approach, as winning is a
fundamental aspect of sports and it must be embraced in the appropriate
manner. The Principles of Ethical Youth Coaching shows coaches how to
develop the character of their players while embracing the competi ti ve nature
of sports." />
