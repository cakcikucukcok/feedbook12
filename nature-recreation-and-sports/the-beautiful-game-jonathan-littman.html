  <title>The Beautiful Game - Jonathan Littman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once nobody noticed Santa Rosa&#39;s Thunder. They were a ragtag team of girls who wanted to play soccer, and no one took them seriously. Their male coach expected little from his &quot;ladies, &quot; and their mediocre performance convinced them he was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a kind of miracle happened. Emiria Salzmann, Thunder&#39;s new coach, a top player herself, knew what it took to win--discipline, relentless drills, thigh-burning sprints, and an inspired passing game. The girls hated it, but their coach never let up. Tough and determined, she showed them what it felt like to be winners--and they loved it. As the momentum grew with a string of victories, the girls thrived on the competition, believing they had the right stuff to become champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were right! With spirits soaring, Thunder won its league on the last day of the season and headed for the state cup, emerging not just as powerful athletes but as strong, confident, emotionally healthy human beings--champions in the game of soccer, and in the game of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
