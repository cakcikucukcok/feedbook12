  <title>Close Encounters on a Golf Course - Lena Hagman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lena Hagman has found a unique way of telling stories that are not usually told though they are about the utter joy we all can sense whenever we meet someone who can share the splendor of being who we are, in an activity that brings every aspect of our personalities out in the open, as during a round of golf.
The author dedicates her book to the Ailsa Golf Course, which has a very special place in her heart. Several of her close encounters described in the book have taken place at Turnberry, on the Ailsa course on the western shore of Scotland. Ailsa is the historic links championship course where the Open Championship has been held four times." />
