  <title>Threestars’ Decision=The Minimum of 3Cs from the South - Ben Fikilini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is about Basketball. This is Basketball. Let us talk about Basketball. I am not going to talk about it all. Since I am just a fan; I want to talk about something I can predict. Predictions as we know them can sometimes come true. I also want to talk about something that has never happened before, but from now on we all may see it happening. I also want to be controversial. I am both a Basketball-game and a basketball players fan. I know many fans like me were surprised to hear about the birth of the Threestars Decision (TD).
				Prior to the birth of Threestars Decision a lot had been said regarding one of the best basketball players in the world. Some people especially the sports-talk-show-hosts had been debating about the future of this great player. This greatest basketball player came into this game with unbelievable talent and power of the game that within a few years in the game was popular than most of the players who had been in the game for a longer time than he has. We all watched him play. We all judged him both in the field of play and outside the field of play. In both, field of play and outside field of play, he had demonstrated respect of the game and the respect of the fans and the respect of the media, and all." />
