  <title>The Book of Five Rings - D. E. Tarver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For centuries, &lt;I&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/I&gt; has been a resource for gaining insight into the mind of the warrior spirit.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The famous Samurai, Miyamoto Musashi, originally wrote the work in 1645. Musashi, the Sword Saint, as he is known in Japan, killed his first man in a duel when he was only thirteen. He went on to fight in over sixty duels and never once lost.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/i&gt;, Musashi recorded his secrets to success which are applicable to martial arts and any modern situation involving confrontation. Until &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/i&gt;, the many translations of his original work are written from an academic standpoint because the authors have little with the sword or martial arts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;D.E. Tarver brings a lifetime of experience in sword training, martial arts and business to this version, and the result is a highly motivating and easy to understand book. If you are serious about winning in any area of your life, &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive guide to victory." />
