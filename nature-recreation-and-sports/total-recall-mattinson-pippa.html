  <title>TOTAL RECALL - MATTINSON PIPPA</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many dog owners struggle to manage their dogs, and the vast majority of people who need help have one simple but overwhelming problem. Their dog won t come back when they call him. Through focusing on this single and most important of obedience commands, Pippa Mattinson shows the dog owner whether of a puppy or an adult dog how to build up a reliable recall successfully, layer by layer, and step by step, using effective and positive training techniques. The author offers the reader an insight into the mind of the dog and explains exactly why dogs behave in the way that they do. Training exercises are described in unique detail, and with the inclusion of a helpful problem solving section, nothing is left to chance. Total Recall is much more than a recall training book. It is a detailed reference and guide to canine behaviour and dog training that will fascinate dog owners in the UK and abroad" />
