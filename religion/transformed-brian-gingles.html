  <title>Transformed - Brian Gingles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever asked yourself what Gods plan is for your life? Brian Gingles explores the extraordinary claims the Bible makes, about the wonderful poem God wants to fashion out of your life, if you are willing to cooperate with Him. Transformed encourages you to discover how this can happen. It also seeks biblical answers to questions such as: What was Gods original intention for humanity? Did the fall of mankind destroy that plan? How can God heal our emotions and renew our minds? What are some of the key big, dangerous ideas that currently oppose biblical teaching? What part do tests, trials, and suffering play in our lives? What about the mystery of death? What is Gods ultimate plan for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a better, more purposeful, and focused individual is possible, with the help of the Holy Spirit. God has a much more exciting ambition for you than you might have fully realised. He wants to make you like Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn what the Bible has to say about Gods extraordinary love for mankind and His wonderful grace in taking the unpromising chrysalises of our lives, to transform them into something free, clean, and beautiful in His eyes. Is it possible that God can change you from one degree of glory to another? Discussion questions at the end of Transformed offer the opportunity for further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also see that Gods plans for us do not end with the death of our mortal bodies. See how we will be changed forever when Christ returns!&lt;/p&gt;" />
