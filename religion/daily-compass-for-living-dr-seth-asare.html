  <title>Daily Compass for Living - Dr. Seth Asare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some of my friends, students, and parishioners have asked me why I stopped sending out the word for the day in 2011. That was the year I retired from active service. Upon popular request, I have decided to compile some of my daily blogs into a devotional that could be used alongside other resources. They are now called the Daily Compass.
These are reflections and thoughts on Bible verses for each day. There is no attempt to do an exegesis of passages or provide information for a Bible study. So feel free to disagree with me, but I pray that a sentence or two may challenge and uplift your spirit during the day.
The goals of these reflections are to inspire, challenge, encourage, and help individuals find a bearing as they navigate their way through each day. The ways in which God has used people in the Bible are lifted up as our guide and compass for living.
My prayer is that the Holy Spirit will breathe life into these words for someone who is struggling with the challenge of being a Christian in our modern society. Be blessed as you read along." />
