  <title>The Reality of Infinity and the Existence - Yilmaz Gökdeniz, Dilek Çeltik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book consists of theoretical articles in cosmology and theology. The main focus of these articles is &quot;the reality of infinity.&quot; Infinity, whose cognizable definition based on scientific facts has not been made so far, has been regarded as a virtual numeric concept, and as the last stage of greatness and diminutiveness used as a scale by scientists and men of religion. This book asserts that neither numbers nor numerical entities will ever be infinite. Numbers are not natural; they are not real, and they are virtual concepts; they stem from the way of thought and willpower of human being. The reality of infinity is a concept of cosmology. Due to the endlessness of infinity, it is possible to define and to understand it with the reality of infinity considering the principles of infinity. The book explains that the beliefs and notions of scientists and men of religion are outcome of their own comprehension of the nature of the universe and of religion, and focuses on how their theories, depending generally on metaphysics or meta-science, are far from reflecting the realities. In the book, &quot;The Nature of the Universe&quot;, &quot;The Natural Basic Forces and the Universal Balances,&quot; &quot;Blackholes&quot;, &quot;Gamma Ray Bursts&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Background Radiation&quot; and other subjects like &quot;Predestination (destiny)&quot; &quot;Divine Justice&quot; and &quot;The Existence and Doomsday&quot; have been rationally explained. Briefly, &quot;in this book, further to the known, new ideas and notions introduced in the realms of cosmology and theology are revolutionary.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
