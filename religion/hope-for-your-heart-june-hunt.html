  <title>Hope for Your Heart - June Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hope is one of the prominent themes of the Bible. Despite Scripture&amp;rsquo;s teaching on the subject, however, the true, biblical meaning of hope is often misunderstood or reduced to mere sentimentalism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Respected author and counselor June Hunt champions the healing power of hope. Stemming from Hunt&amp;rsquo;s ministry, Hope For the Heart, this book speaks on a subject central to her calling. She explains how hope is much more than a vague emotion and specifies the ways it has the power to change lives. Shunning pop psychology and shallow inspirationalism, she instead consistently and faithfully looks at what the Bible says about hope. Each chapter flows from a central Scripture passage and is illustrated by real-life stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those experiencing brokenness and hurt will find encouragement and healing as they encounter the hope of the Bible. Written from a counselor&amp;rsquo;s heart, this book will also benefit pastors and others engaged in counseling ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
