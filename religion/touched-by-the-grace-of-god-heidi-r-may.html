  <title>Touched by the Grace of God - Heidi R. May</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains 70 true stories about prayers that were answered, healings, visions, signs from deceased loved ones, out-of-body experiences and other unexplained wonderful occurrences. Heidi made it her mission to confirm, and accurately maintain, the individuality of each story as it was told to her. Each contributor somehow felt the subtle grace of God because his or her personal experience was beyond coincidence.  You will be filled with faith, awe, wonder, peace and the realization that miracles occur more frequently than you believed possible. You will discover three miracles that occurred in Lana&#39;s bedroom. What did the radiologist see on Maddie&#39;s X-ray? Was it a mishandling error of some kind or something divine? You decide. Can a woman be healed from the incurable condition of torticollis? Is there really a tunnel of light we enter as we near death? Can a child heal herself from hydrocephalus? Read the stories &quot;Peggy Ann&quot; and &quot;The 14th Hole&quot;  to find out if angels exist. Observe the power of prayer in the story &quot;Trisha&#39;s Lump.&quot;
     All of the royalties from this book will be donated to St. Jude Children&#39;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.
     This book was a &quot;Finalist&quot; in the 2012 International Book Awards in the category of Religion:Christian Inspirational. It was also an honorable mention in the Spiritual category in the 2012 San Francisco Book Festival." />
