  <title>The English Bible Translations and History - John C. Greider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The English Bible Translations and History, Millennium Edition, is a study of the translations of the Bible from the time of Jerome (404 A.D.) to the publication of the Authorized Version in 1611. This book covers the Reformation in England, the reigns of King Henry VIII, Queen Elizabeth, and legislation during this time (1534-1662) frame. It is also a study (604-1750) of the historical, political, and the theological problems relating to Rome, the popes, councils, changes in England and Europe, and the rise of the Protestants and Non-Conformists (1382-1517). Many problems relating to the translations of the Bible into English, and Doctrines of the Roman Church, are also discussed in this book. This study covers (1382-1750) the development of the Vulgate, the translations of John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, the Coverdale Bible, the Great Bible, the Bishops Bible, the Geneva Bible, the Matthews Bible, the Rheims-Douay Bible, and the Authorized Version. Related Bible translations, problems, and history are also discussed in this work. This study also explains the Inquisition (1184), the Great Schism of the Catholic Church (1309-1417), the Index (1557), the rise (1382-1689) of the Reformers, St. Bartholomew Days Massacre (1572), the printing of various Bibles (1526-1750) in English for Catholics and Protestants and movements in education and reform in England. The Reformers (1382-1611) faced many theological and political problems in trying to bring vernacular translations of the Scriptures to church members; this study explains many of these theological and historical issues. A bibliography is listed for further study on the subject. Cover photo by Author." />
