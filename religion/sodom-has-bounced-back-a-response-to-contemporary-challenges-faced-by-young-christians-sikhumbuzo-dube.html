  <title>Sodom Has Bounced Back: A Response to Contemporary Challenges Faced By Young Christians - Sikhumbuzo Dube</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The city of Sodom had not only become the hub of variety of activities but a rendezvous for perpetrators of all forms of vice. The crime and vice must have been fuelled by economic pressures among other factors. Although the economy of Sodom was thriving, many young people could have been living in abject poverty. Many unemployed young people killed their time by beer drinking and loitering - as a result they got hooked to a number of sexual mores. Beautiful young women signed up with rich businessmen who hired them out for escort services to wealthy visitors. The city adult book and video stores, the one night (fornicatory) stands and porn shops were teeming with wicked men of Sodom. This book addresses current hot potatoes like homosexuality, lesbianism, revisionist gay theology, the occult, music television and its impact, premarital/non-marital sex and materialism through looking glasses of Lot&#39;s story. It focuses on a redemptive ministry approach to these issues." />
