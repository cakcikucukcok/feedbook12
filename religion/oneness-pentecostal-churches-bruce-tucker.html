  <title>Oneness Pentecostal Churches - Bruce Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are approximately 111 separate sects and denominations that are classified as Oneness Pentecostal Churches. These congregations are found in nearly every city and town in the United States, as well as around the world. They get their distinctive name from the fact that they do not believe in the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. They believe that all who do believe in the Trinity are spiritually lost because they have adopted a pagan doctrine. They differ from other Pentecostals and the rest of the historical church on several important issues, earning them the title of a Pseudo-Christian Cult by established cult watching organizations and cult experts. The book, Oneness Pentecostal Churches, examines the claims, doctrines and practices of these fellowships. It addresses the issues in a manner comprehensive enough to satisfy the professional minister, yet clear enough to meet the needs of laypeople who are seeking answers about this significant movement.
The questions discussed in the book include: 
1.) Who are Oneness Pentecostals?
2.)Why are Oneness Pentecostals called &quot;the people of the name&quot;? 
3.)Is the doctrine of the Trinity really pagan? 4.)Is there a three step pathway to salvation? 
5.)Does water baptism save?
6.)Is speaking in tongues required for salvation? 
For those interested in understanding the Oneness Pentecostal movement, this book is required reading." />
