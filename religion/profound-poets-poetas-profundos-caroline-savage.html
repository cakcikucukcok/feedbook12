  <title>Profound Poets // Poetas Profundos - Caroline Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Profound Poets encourages individuals reading to remain cognizant that our children are not only the church of today but also of tomorrow. Children worship and praise the same God we do as our Lord is actively present in all our lives. Our children&#39;s hearts are also geared toward honoring Him. As parents, guardians, and family members, understanding that the Christian Discipleship process begins at home, we must empower and encourage our children, God&#39;s children, to seek our Lords face, connect with His heart and pursue His guidance. Children&#39;s ideas are very relevant and we must remind them that they can accomplish anything in Christ who strengthens them (Philippians 4:13). Luke 18:16 states, But Jesus called the children to him and said, `Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these (NIV). 
The Children of the Christian Mission of Panama are using the power of God&#39;s words to share spiritual knowledge expressing their love for God! This book encourages children to use their God-given gifts, talents and ideas to proclaim the Good News of the Gospel. As you read this book, invite the Lord into your heart. Ask Him to minister to you in a very special way. Consider the ways of the childrenCan we benefit from their expertise and examples? Always remember, God can use a child to accomplish His will and purpose in your life. Jesus did
These commandments that I give you today are to be on your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates (Deuteronomy 6:6-9, NIV)." />
