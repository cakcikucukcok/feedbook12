  <title>Squished! - S.L. Estes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Crash! Sundays attendance was chaos. Anger, shock, curiosity, and despair rocked our group. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the beginning of a year and a half of my home church searching for a new pastor. In desperation, I began reading the Bible, looking for truth, hope, and faithfulness. This book comes from my journal as I wrote down things I learned afresh from the Bible. In the end, I realized God was asking me whether I was walking by faith or by sight. In those eighteen months, I discovered walking by faith is more satisfying than walking by sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you experiencing a church split or any difficulties? Is God squashing you painfully through a press right now?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Read this book to find out how God took what I thought was fruit-bearing service to Him and squashed me through a press, making me something more useful for Him, just by getting me reading His Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fresh new look into Gods Word was an eye-opener!&lt;/p&gt;" />
