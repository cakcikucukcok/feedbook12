  <title>I Love Thy Law: An Expository Study of the Book of Malachi - Christopher Bickish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a commentary, or Bible study, of the Old Testament Book of Malachi focusing on the fear of the Lord.  It is my prayer that this commentary may encourage and edify the one who chooses to use it.  This exposition may aid Sunday school teachers, church institute instructors, Bible study leaders, missionaries or pastors who wish to go through Malachi in an expository fashion.  Study Questions are included at the back of the work.  The utmost care has been given to the proper rendering of the Masoretic Hebrew text behind the King James translation.  A translation is only as good as it is faithful to the original text; therefore, the Hebrew text itself, and not the English translation, has been the guiding light of this work.  With that said, I appreciate the integrity and accuracy of the King James translation; therefore, apart from my own rendering of the Hebrew text, it is the only translation which has been used in the production of this work.  Topics include divorce, remarriage, and tithing." />
