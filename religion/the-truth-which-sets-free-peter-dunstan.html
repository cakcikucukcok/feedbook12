  <title>The Truth Which Sets Free - Peter Dunstan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;He who has ears let him hear.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
Jesus said those words many times. What did he mean? He also declared, &quot;The truth will set you free.&quot; Which truth? Free from what? This book will tell you in no uncertain terms, a message to be stapled on the world&#39;s bulletin board for any who pass by, and in particular for those who have the &quot;right ears.&quot; It is a thorough explanation of the astonishing freedom won by Christ for his elect and the devastating implications this has for all world religion and philosophy, especially Christianity. It will shatter the myths underpinning many long cherished beliefs and rock the Church to its foundations. Along with many other surprises you will discover that the word &quot;church&quot; is not even in the Bible!
&lt;p&gt;
This investigation covers most aspects of the Church with special reference to its origin in early times: fathers, councils, creeds, buildings, names and titles, saints, priesthood and clergy, celibacy, ordination, confirmation, sacraments, tithes, sabbaths, festivals, gospels and media, assurance, second-coming and ecumenical beliefs. All these are weighed against Scripture, namely the teachings of Christ, the apostles and prophets, and found to be either non-existent, obsolete, not the same thing or quite the opposite! However, these concepts did not materialize from nothing; all came from someone, somewhere. The revelation of each source will be quite a shock for readers who thought they had a handle on the facts.  Well-documented and researched but written in dynamic style, this presentation is often moving and alarming.
&lt;p&gt;
