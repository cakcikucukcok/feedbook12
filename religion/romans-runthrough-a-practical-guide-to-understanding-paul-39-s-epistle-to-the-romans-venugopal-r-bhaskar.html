  <title>Romans Runthrough: A practical guide to understanding Paul&#39;s epistle to the Romans - Venugopal R Bhaskar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Has God given you a reason to believe in His love? Yes He has. The love of God is not an abstract concept. God has really done something tangible. In fact, He proved his love and now gives you a reason to trust Him having done the most unreasonable thing you could ever imagine. Have you ever heard of anyone dying for another? Well, maybe rarely someone may choose to die for a good person, a person they love, respect or adore. However, have you ever heard of a person who died for an enemy or for an evil man? Never! It is not logical or reasonable. It is unfathomable. But God did just that. While we were deep in sin, rooted in darkness and lost from the presence of God, He sent His own and beloved Son to die on our behalf, so we could be reconciled to him. Can you ask for a better reason to understand God&#39;s love? Are you still telling God, &quot;Prove your love to me&quot;? It is a foolish statement to make. If you have doubts about the love of God, just look to the cross. The most unreasonable act of love was performed by God to give you a reason to believe." />
