  <title>The Power of the Resurrection - Francis Innocent Otobo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Resurrection of Jesus is one of the central beliefs of the Christian faith. This belief and teaching cut across all the Christian denominations. Hence, Paul teaches that if Christ had not risen from the dead, then we would have been the most foolish of all religious groups. But the fact that He, Christ, died and came back to life gives us the opportunity to glory in the resurrected Christ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book, The Power of the Resurrection, is centered on the resurrection of Jesus, and the meaning that this resurrection has for us as individual Christians, who believe in the risen Lord. It is not a theological work aimed at defining the resurrection, nor is it a historical work aimed at tracing or verifying the veracity the resurrection. No. It is rather a faith lifting book on the basis of the resurrection story as we have it in the Christian bible. Just as Jesus rose from the dead in the midst of all the opposing tides, so shall those who trust in him rise above all opposing tides in their life. Jesus could not be stopped, so also by the grace of Him who rose from the dead; nothing is going to stop your upliftment and manifestation also. The resurrection shall be your experience in your daily life and at the end of time, he who raised Jesus from the dead shall give life to your own mortal body too. This is the argument of the book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Jesus, the son of God, came into the world for the love of humanity. His teachings were misunderstood, and so through the journey to Calvary, he was crucified and died on the cross on Calvary. Yes he died. The chief priests and the scribes and the Pharisees, in conjunction with Pilate, conspired against him. He was sentenced to death. He accepted the death willingly and lovingly. He died that we might be saved. Hence, his death brought salvation to the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
However, before he died, he promised the resurrection. He did not hide the fact of the resurrection. Openly he said, the son of man shall be delivered into the hand of sinners, he shall be put to death, but on the third day, he will rise again. In another place, he said, destroy this temple, and in three days, I shall raise it up, and there was misunderstanding again. The people thought he was referring to the physical temple, but from scripture, we know he was referring to his body rising from the dead. Thus he did spoke about the resurrection quite clearly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is where this book hinges its weight. Because he promised the resurrection, after the execution, the chief priests and the soldiers, knowing what he was capable of doing, asked the permission of Pilate for the grave to be guarded till the third day. This is because he said on the third day, I will rise again. They knew that it could happen. They said: this man who gave sight to the blind, who raised the dead (Lazarus and also Jairus Daughter), who cleansed lepers, who casts out devils; this same man said on the third day I will rise again. And they concluded:  if he should rise again from the dead, then it will be worse for us. Hence, they received the permission to guard the grave, to prevent any rising from the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Humanly speaking therefore, the resurrection would not have been possible. This is because they did everything to prevent it. They put a very big stone to wedge the entrance, hence no coming out and no going in. More so, they stayed on guard with weapons to prevent any fraudulent act. They were prepared to kill again even if he should try to come out of the grave; that is, if he was able to overcome the wedging stone. Therefore, from the human point of view, it was impossible. By their calculation, they have overcome, they have conquered, and they have become victorious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But one thing they failed to understand was the statement of the Angel, which Jesus himself repeated to the apostles; that for men, it may be impossible, but not for God, because, for God, there is no impossibility. And so when the appo" />
