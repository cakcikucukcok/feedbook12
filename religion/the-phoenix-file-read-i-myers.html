      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;THE PHOENIX FILE&lt;/b&gt; is written as a satire focusing on the destructive results of
religious atheism as it is imposed in the form of law. If it goes unchallenged
every citizen will be required to live within THE BARN of a culturalized atheism.
The future of freedom is in the balance. A choice lies before our nations. If
we want continued freedom we must re-examine and reassert our founding
Judeo-Christian values. Failing this our children will be subjected to a fully
intolerant and militant atheism. Pragmatic atheism can never take credit for
generating our historic religious freedoms, or such things as our system of
law, property rights and the guaranteed right to life. Once these God-given
rights and freedoms are lost they are only recovered at great cost. So either
we stand and insist that our historic values be defended or become nations
of slaves. Few, it appears, have the heart for such a struggle. Our children will
live with the choice made. May I suggest therefore that you read carefully?" />
