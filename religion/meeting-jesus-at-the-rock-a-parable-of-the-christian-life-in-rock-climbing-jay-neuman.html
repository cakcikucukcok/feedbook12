  <title>Meeting Jesus At the Rock: A Parable of the Christian Life In Rock Climbing - Jay Neuman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rock climbing is a spiritual experience.  Spending time in nature is spending time in God&#39;s cathedrals.  The ones he has made with his own hands.  This book started as an outline for a five day rock climbing course and spiritual workshop.  Each morning would start out with a rock climbing lesson.  The group would then spend the day climbing and practicing the skills from that day&#39;s lesson.  In the afternoon, there would be a time of life application and discussion.  Then the book took on a life of its own.      What started as a few spiritual lessons learned through interacting with God&#39;s creation became a parable for our life&#39;s journey through five stages of spiritual maturity.  Along the way, it presents a roadmap to a deeper and more genuine Christian faith.   This new version includes a 7-part bible study discussion guide - Seven Spiritual Principles of Rock Climbing." />
