  <title>The Ministry of Restoration - Dr. Ron Pleune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest challenges for churches today is to minister to the brothers and sisters who have stumbled in their walk with the Lord and have been caught up in sin. In The Ministry of Restoration, author Dr. Ron Pleune discusses whose responsibility it is to be concerned with the restoration process of those who have fallen into sin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the Word of God, The Ministry of Restoration explores what it means to be overtaken by sin and considers who is responsible for restoring the sinners back to their faith. It addresses techniques in counseling; offers suggestions on how to handle sin, forgiveness, bitterness, and shame; and provides guidance for taking the steps to move forward in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Scripture, personal reflection, and ecclesiastical examples, Pleune maintains it is the whole church communitys responsibility to reach out to those who have fallen away from God. The Ministry of Restoration teaches that all church members should be a part of Gods plan for healing: read with your eyes, review with your thoughts, reinforce with your heart, and restore with your actions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
