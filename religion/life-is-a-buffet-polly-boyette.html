  <title>Life Is a Buffet - Polly Boyette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So what&#39;s on your plate? Have you piled more on your plate than you can possibly handle? Do you have healthy portions of love, compassion, loyalty, vision and encouragement or, have you allowed unhealthy servings of negativity, broken promises, unforgiveness, and disappointment to fill your plate?&lt;p&gt;
Life is a buffet because it offers a wide variety of new choices every day. You have to make sure to exercise wisdom in your choices, taking great care in what you allow onto your plate. You also serve out of what you take in. That means family, friends, neighbors, co-workers or even strangers are impacted by the choices you make.&lt;p&gt;
In this second book in the &quot;Life is a Buffet&quot; series, &quot;So What&#39;s On Your Plate,&quot; Polly Boyette uses inspirational humor and real life experiences to illustrate the importance of the choices you make every day.&lt;p&gt;
If you put God first, He will help you to make the best choices to ensure a healthy and balanced life. Remember, the choices you make today will impact your life and the lives of others for years to come." />
