  <title>Why They Must Go - Terrell McCoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance Praise for &lt;i&gt;Why They Must Go&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
A must read for everyone who loves and values our children and youth and wants to see them saved in Gods kingdom.
Dr. Penny Lister Smith, Education Superintendent, South Atlantic Conference
An excellent piece of reading material; I trust that it will reawaken the purpose of SDA education!
Shakuntala Ramsarran, Education Superintendent, Southwest Region Conference
I highly recommend the reading and study of Terrell McCoys new book (which) highlights the need for home, church, and school to work together in the preparation of our offspring to meet the challenges of life on this earth while also preparing the children that God has given us to live in Eternity with the Master Teacher.
Dr. Doug Walker, Former Education Director, Southwestern Union
An outgrowth of a series of sermons delivered on Christian education by author Terrell McCoy, &lt;i&gt;Why They Must Go&lt;/i&gt; presents strong arguments for providing Seventh-day Adventist children with an Adventist education. Expounding on the purpose and the goals of a Christian education, McCoy argues that children are Gods property and they must be related to in Gods way. He urges parents to keep the church in church schools." />
