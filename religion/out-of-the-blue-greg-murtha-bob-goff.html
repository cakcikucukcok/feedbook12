  <title>Out of the Blue - Greg Murtha, Bob Goff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Greg Murtha&amp;#39;s high-achiever life didn&amp;#39;t go as planned. Not even close. Cancer interrupted it. And in Greg&amp;#39;s words:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;#39;s a good thing because, without cancer, I would never have embraced the joy of following Jesus with reckless abandon or experienced the exhilaration of sensing the promptings of the Holy Spirit. I would never have acted in obedience to what he leads me to do (what he has wired me to do) or joined him in his master plan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In God&amp;#39;s grace, he allowed me to get so sick I had to slow down, abandon my plans, move out of the way, and learn to trust him by just being. Frankly, I would rather enjoy life this way (God&amp;#39;s way) if only for a few years, than live for decades wrapped up in my small, timid plans and the insecurities present in that lifestyle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without cancer, I would have remained that somber, self-righteous, smug, narrow-minded Christian who turns people off: the Christian who judges instead of loves, clings tightly to the status-quo plan, and thinks he can earn God&amp;#39;s approval. The Christian who misses the joy of simply following Jesus the way he intended. You might say, cancer got me out of my performance-based, fearful existence and into the bigger story&amp;mdash;the grand adventure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following Jesus in the unexpected led Greg to life-giving exploits, and he wants the same for you. Because lots of things interrupt our well-planned lives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Out of the Blue&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will help you embrace interruption as adventure, rather than adversity. It will lead you to the exhilarating bigger story&amp;mdash;God&amp;#39;s story&amp;mdash;and your unexpected role in it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
