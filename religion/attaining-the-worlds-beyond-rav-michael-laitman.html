  <title>Attaining the Worlds beyond - Rav Michael Laitman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Late in the evening in September 1991, a notebook was passed to Michael Laitman containing the transcripts from one of the greatest Kabbalists of all time. For thousands of years the secrets of Kabbalah have been guarded from the eyes of strangers and only to be revealed at certain times. The time has come to unveil the secrets that provide the answer to the question all men in all times have asked themselves: What is the meaning of my life? Attaining The Worlds Beyond is based on the notebook given to the author by Rabbi Baruch Ashlag just before he perished. This notebook contained all the transcripts of the conversations with his father, Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag; the Rabbi of Jerusalem, and the greatest Kabbalist in our generation. Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag left a study method for this generation, which is suitable for anyone wishing to use it. &quot;This method is a practical way to apprehend the upper world and the source of our existence while still living in this world." />
