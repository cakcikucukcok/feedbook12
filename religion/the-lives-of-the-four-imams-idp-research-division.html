  <title>The Lives of the Four Imams - Idp Research Division</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In todays times there seems to be a lot of confusion when it comes to the subject of following a madhab and Fiqhi Rulings. This seems to be one of the major reasons behing the differences and disagreements in the Muslim Ummah, especially today. However, it is of great importance to know about the lives of four Jurists of Islam whose works have survived until this day. Their juristic pronouncements have held sway over the entire Muslim world throughout history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This concise treatise will help us get to understand some of their methodologies when it came to extracting rulings from the two main sources of Islam, the Qur&amp;#39;an and Hadeeth. Although this treatise does not prove to remove all of the confusions and doubts among the Muslims, it definitely serves as a beginning point in order to get to know who these great Jurists of Islam were. I believe that for a simple layman, this book will prove extremely beneficial as a starting point before moving on to reading more advanced literature on this subject.&lt;br /&gt;
