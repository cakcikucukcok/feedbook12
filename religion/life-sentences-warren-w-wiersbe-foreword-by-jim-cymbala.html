  <title>Life Sentences - Warren W. Wiersbe, Foreword by Jim Cymbala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This observation by the great preacher Charles Spurgeon launched Warren Wiersbe on a study of the lives of prominent Bible characters. Interested in more than biographical facts, Wiersbe sought out the themes of each person’s life as reflected in the pages of Scripture. How does the Bible summarize this person’s life? What is the key to understanding his or her character? How do I see my own life reflected in the life of this person?Here is the fruit of this study. A popular reference book with a pastoral and devotional flavor, Life Sentences takes you into the lives of sixty-three men and women who encountered an extraordinary God. For each, Wiersbe identifies a verse that sums up that individual’s life and then reflects on the lessons to be learned, both positive and negative. Not only will you be challenged by these examples, you will be stimulated to consider what your “life sentence” will be.Life Sentences is an ideal reference tool for teachers, Bible study leaders, and preachers seeking to bring Bible characters to life. But it is written from a pastor’s heart, so it also makes ideal devotional reading for anyone who wants to more clearly understand the Bible and apply it to life." />
