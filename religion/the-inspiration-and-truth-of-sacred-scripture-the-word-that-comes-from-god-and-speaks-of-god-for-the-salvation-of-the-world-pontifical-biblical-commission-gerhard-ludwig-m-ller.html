  <title>The Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture: The Word that Comes from God and Speaks of God for the Salvation of the World - Pontifical Biblical Commission, Gerhard Ludwig Müller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In his 2009 post-synodal apostolic exhortation &lt;I&gt;Verbum Domini&lt;/I&gt;, Pope Benedict XVI pointed out that &amp;ldquo;theological reflection has always considered inspiration and truth as two key concepts for an ecclesial hermeneutic of the sacred Scriptures&amp;rdquo; and that there is today the need &amp;ldquo;for a fuller and more adequate study of these realities, in order to better respond to the need of interpreting the sacred texts in accordance with their nature.&amp;rdquo;&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Inspiration and Truth of Sacred Scripture: The Word That Comes from God and Speaks of God for the Salvation of the World&lt;/I&gt; is the contribution of the Pontifical Biblical Commission toward a more adequate understanding of the concepts of inspiration and truth that respects both the nature of the Bible and its significance for the life of the Church.
