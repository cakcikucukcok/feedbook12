  <title>The Jigsaw of Life - Richard Bryant-Jefferies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is life some chance occurrence on one large rock spinning around an insignificant sun on the edge of the universe? Or is there a larger picture to life, a greater unseen purpose?&lt;/P&gt;
From cosmic evolution to human diversity, life is like a jigsaw of many pieces evolving to find their potential and place in the final picture.&lt;/P&gt;
Richard Bryant-Jefferies takes you on a fascinating journey from cosmic creation through the threat of competitive separateness to human responsibility, identifying key qualities-pieces of the jigsaw of life-to be set in place in the world to enable the purpose of creation to be fulfilled and revealed.&lt;/P&gt;
&quot;  through a series of gentle reflections from a wide variety of perspectives the reader is drawn to consider what it means to be a human being.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
-Steve Nation, from his Foreword&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;  meaningful for practitioners in, or people committed to, the Person-Centered Approach and who are interested in a spiritual dimension   important reading for those people who are searching for their own answers in trying to make sense of these type of questions and have no prior knowledge or interest in the Person-Centered Approach.&quot;&lt;/br&gt;
