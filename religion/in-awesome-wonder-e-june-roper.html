  <title>In Awesome Wonder - E. June Roper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For through Him God created everything in heaven and on earth, the seen and the unseen things, including spiritual powers, lords, rulers, and authorities. God created the whole universe through Him and for Him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Colossians 1:16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Mighty Hand of God&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With one divine decision, history began. Existence became measurable. Because God spoke out, out of nothing came light. Out of this light came day. Then, in obedience to His command came the sky and earth. And on this earth we call home, His mighty hand went to work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Canyons were carved deep into the face of the earth, oceans were dug, mountains erupted out of flat land, stars were flung into the heavens, and a new universe sparkled simply because Almighty God spoke and willed it so! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All we must do is look at the Grand Canyons splendor and touch the gentle fragrant petals of a flower and we see His loving delicate work. We but have to listen to thunder and see the storm to stand in awe of His mighty power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As you travel through each day, you will encounter Gods creation. As you see the beauty around you, allow each detail to remind you to bow down before Him and lift up your hands in praise. We should daily express our appreciation for Gods creations around us. As parents, we must encourage our children to see the beauty of His love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
