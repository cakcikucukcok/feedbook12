  <title>Soul Minister - Colette A. Nemedia-Kuponiyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sole reason for getting this publication out was to provide easily digested soul food to the famished and the faint. Through my observation, I discovered how much food and consumption was out there in the world such as for the belly, the body, the brain by way of food, fashion and fiction and not much for the soul, an area that is not easily satisfied and most times ignored and which can only be satisfied with the word of god.
&lt;i&gt;Soul Minister&lt;/i&gt; is a down to earth production simply for the satisfaction and succor of the soul. It offers an easy access and read to believers as well as unbelievers by opening them up further to receive from their maker and the creator and rightful owner of our souls." />
