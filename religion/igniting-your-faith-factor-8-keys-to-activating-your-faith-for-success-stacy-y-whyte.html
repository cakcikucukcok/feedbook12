  <title>Igniting Your Faith Factor : 8 Keys to Activating Your Faith For Success - Stacy Y. Whyte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be this hard. You feel like you&amp;rsquo;ll never get out of the cycle of addiction or abuse you&amp;rsquo;ve been in for years. You struggle day after day just to pay the bills and make ends meet. Even your health isn&amp;rsquo;t what it used to be. In these moments of despair, you feel abandoned &amp;ndash; by family, by friends, and most of all, by God himself. While it may not feel like it, there is an end. There is a way out. And there is a God who loves you more than anyone on earth, a God who will make you whole and give you everything you need to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Igniting Your Faith Factor&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shares the experiences of eight women who have survived domestic abuse, cancer, addiction, and depression. Empowered by a renewed faith in God, these women triumphed over adversities and now serve as examples of what faith can achieve. These women are proof that it is never too late to take back your life &amp;ndash; as long as you put your trust in Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book is for anyone who feels trapped, lost, abandoned, and hopeless. It will lift you up with words of encouragement, pulling you out of darkness and into the light of Christ. If your life feels uprooted, or if you simply need a reality check of what truly matters most,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Igniting Your Faith Factor&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is the guidance you need.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
