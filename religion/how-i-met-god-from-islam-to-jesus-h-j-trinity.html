  <title>How I Met God…From Islam to Jesus - H.J. Trinity</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the corners of every culture lurk stories of tragedy and triumph. How I Met God  from Islam to Jesus describes a captivating story of H. J. Trinitys tumultuous yet courageous journey from Iran to America, and from Islam to Christianity. H. J. Trinity was a Muslim woman born in the heart of the Middle East, who always felt insignificant, empty, and displaced by the strictness of Islam, her unloving family, and a morbid culture. Those negative forces ultimately left her with an aching void that plagued her entire life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night, due to a personal tragedy that left her emotionally paralyzed, she lost all hope and faith in God. But that same night, her void was filled when she personally met Jesus, who then introduced her to God for the first time. And from that moment on, she continued to water the seed of happiness that God had planted in her heart. Her personal conviction, led by Jesus, propelled her to succeed in staving off all fears deriving from family, religion, and culture. Her philosophy and core beliefs have always been to live for love, health, and wealth. After witnessing many miracles, meeting Jesus face to face, and most importantly, having a direct relationship with God, she was inspired to share those experiences with the rest of the world. How I Met God  from Islam to Jesus also shares how she communicates with God directly without following any rituals of religion, culture, or family. You will learn how her new revelation served as her armor against an extremely racist culture, how she was finally able to find peace and harmony through pain and discord, and how she lives her life today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
