  <title>Time with God in Finding Inner Peace - Lalonie Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book is a spiritually teaching book about how to find inner peace by having a relationship with God. It teaches about kindness, forgiveness, love and faith. It will uplift and inspire people who are seeking for something more in their lives, as they will learn that what they are seeking is God. By turning to God in prayer and thankfulness they will finally have the peace in their hearts that they are longing for. It teaches about love and how much love God has for us, as we are all unconditionally loved by God. We are reminded that we are all children of God, and how much goodness God wants to bring into our lives, if we only will open our hearts to receiving Gods love in our lives, by spending time in prayer with HIM every single day. It reminds us that we are Gods most precious gifts, as HE wants the very best for us, and what HE wants in turn is for each of us to spend time talking to HIM, honoring and praising our God, and thanking HIM for the many blessings we have been given from God." />
