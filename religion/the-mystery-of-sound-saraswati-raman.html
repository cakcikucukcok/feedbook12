  <title>The Mystery of Sound - Saraswati Raman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Saraswati Ramans interest and dedication to Sahaja Yoga and its meditation led her to explore a course in medicine, leading to an MD in alternative medicine from the Indian Board for Alternative Sciences, Kolkata, and started off on her journey in music too by learning, just to discover the treatments of various diseases through music and Sahaja Yoga meditation. A lady full of positive vibes and approach toward every aspect of life; ever smiling, her journey to explore the culture of our country and its tradition has taken this form of a beautiful compilation of this literature. We are proud to have her as one of the gems of Sahaja yogis that are blooming on this earth. Jai Shri Mataji. With lots of love. 
Pramila Rao, Krez Kreations, real estate, AdFilms and media 
During the course of her growth in Sahaja Yoga, she met her music teacher Dr. Arun Apte, who greatly influenced her in music, which was also instrumental in bringing a profound change in her health. She continues to practice singing out of love for music, and its impact on the energy centers. I am sure readers of this book will be greatly benefited.
