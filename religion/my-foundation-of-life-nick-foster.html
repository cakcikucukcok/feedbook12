  <title>My Foundation of Life - Nick Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why and How I Wrote This Book
Like many of you I wanted to read the Bible from cover to cover.  I did it on a yearly plan, reading so many verses each night.  After the year was up I was done, a big accomplishment, right?  There was one problem: I forgot what I had read.  This was not the result I wanted.  So I read it again, but this time I wrote the verses that were important to me on 3x5 cards.  I had a total of approximately 50 cards.
These verses became a part of me as I would read them over and over and became My Foundation of Life.  They have helped me, but just as importantly have helped the person I&#39;m dedicating the book to: Lenka. Tracy.  It was her suggestion that I put them in a book so that they could help others as she had been helped by them.  The verses you are about to read are from the New American Standard Bible  and the King James versions  The verses that I gave to Lenka weren&#39;t in any particular order and were paraphrased.  These verses helped me and Lenka.  My hope is that they will help you too..  My faith is Catholic, but I was born a Lutheran and was raised Baptist.  I comment and make observations  on several of these verses  These comments may or may not help you.  It is my perspective.  Yours may be different.  The Bible is very important in my life.  I hope it is important in your life too, but if not maybe it can become so." />
