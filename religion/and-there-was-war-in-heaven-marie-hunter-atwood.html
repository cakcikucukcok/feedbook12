  <title>And There Was War in Heaven - Marie Hunter Atwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, stories learned as children were entertaining but failed as life mentors. We, as well as our children, have failed to retain their principles and in consequence have lost a portion of background history necessary to understanding Gods messages. For instance, why did God give the Law of Moses? Of what purpose were the kings and judges, the flood of Noahs time?  What do the Covenants mean, and why didnt first-century Jews accept the promised Messiah? Why is Revelation a part of His message, since it is in apocalyptic language, and does it have any meaning for us? These questions are important, as they grant knowledge that provides additional sources of honor from which we are able to praise Him more effectively. They are also the background for the New Covenant under which we live. Without them, we would not have reconciliation or salvation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
