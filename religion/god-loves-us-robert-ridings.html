  <title>God Loves Us - Robert Ridings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God Loves Us consists of thirteen lessons that reveal Gods love for you. Each weekly lesson has seven daily challenges for the week. These challenges are aimed in helping you walk each day with the Lord, knowing how he reveals his perfect love for you. Knowing his love brings a lasting peace and joy that only comes from God through the Spirit. At the end of each day, there are five questions to answer, enabling you to reflect on the day. The goal of the thirteen weekly lessons, with seven daily challenges per week, is to renew the mind, where walking and communing with Lord will become natural. The more we commune with, praise, and thank God, the more natural it becomes, because God created us to walk with him. As you complete these weekly lessons and daily challenges, it is my prayer that you will trust the Lord more and live life to the fullest with peace and joy, knowing that God is with you and loves you more than anyone can imagine. You can go to www.foreverlearnaboutGod.com and view a short video that gives an introduction to each lesson.&lt;/p&gt;" />
