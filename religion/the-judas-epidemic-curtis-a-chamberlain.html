  <title>The Judas Epidemic - Curtis A. Chamberlain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why todays postmodern church seems to look so different than the church of years gone by? Have you ever wondered what has happened to that old-time religion that was good enough for your parents and grandparents, but doesnt seem to be good enough for people of today? &lt;em&gt;The Judas Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; will answer those questions for you. It seeks to explain why the church and world governments are running down the wide path of destruction mentioned in John 7:14; who it is that is leading the way down that path; and why you should beware of their deceptive doctrines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read Curt Chamberlains new book, &lt;em&gt;The Judas Epidemic,&lt;/em&gt; with great enthusiasm. The contents are helpful, informative, and interesting. To my knowledge, concerning books, &lt;em&gt;The Judas Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; is unique in that it defends the Word of God and the Lords people by exposing the satanic emergent church and the contemporary movement sweeping across America today.&lt;/p&gt;
