  <title>Crisis of Conscience - Raymond Franz, David Henke, Deborah Dykstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crisis of Conscience&lt;/em&gt; presents the story of a struggle to prevent the erosion of a God-given freedom of conscience and the ensuing dilemma of choosing between loyalty to God and loyalty to one&amp;rsquo;s religion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Former member of the Governing Body of Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses, Raymond Franz delivers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the Watch Tower Society. In response to extraordinary events, Franz tells a unique account of the decision-making sessions of this religion&amp;rsquo;s inner council and the powerful, sometimes dramatic, impact their decisions have on Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses. &lt;em&gt;Crisis of Conscience&lt;/em&gt; offers a penetrating view of the supreme council of this organization, the Governing Body and their life altering power over human lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the events of Raymond Franz&amp;rsquo;s departure from the Governing Body occurred in 1980, the organizational foundation and structure remains the same today, making this account relevant to a whole new generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content: Raymond Franz, formerly a Governing Body member of Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses, shares an account that reveals the inner workings and the decision-making processes of that Body, offering a penetrating view of the life altering power they have over human lives. The final nine of his sixty years as one of Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses were spent on this central executive council. Those years led to his crisis of conscience, which is the theme of this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Based on the entire manuscript of Franz&amp;rsquo;s 2008 printing of &lt;em&gt;Crisis of Conscience&lt;/em&gt;, this fifth edition 2018, also includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Foreword by David Henke, author of &lt;em&gt;Spiritual Abuse Recovery Workbook&lt;/em&gt;, and founder of Watchmen Fellowship, Inc. &amp;mdash; David Henke is a Christian apologist that specializes in the field of Jehovah&amp;#39;s Witnesses, issues of mind control, spiritual abuse, and legalism. In addition to the above workbook, Henke has authored evangelistic and educational tracts, and articles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Excerpts from Franz&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;In Search of Christian Freedom&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Crisis of Conscience&lt;/em&gt; references 30 pages from In Search of Christian Freedom in the footnotes; for the convenience of the reader, these pages have been added to Appendix B.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is the &amp;ldquo;Great Crowd&amp;rdquo; Serving God? &lt;/em&gt;by Jon A. Mitchell, a former secretary to the Governing Body &amp;mdash; As a secretary to the Governing Body, and member of the Service Department, Mitchell observed events during and immediately after Raymond Franz&amp;rsquo; resignation from the Governing Body and numerous people were moved, demoted or disfellowshipped. As a result Jon Mitchell authored a booklet called &lt;em&gt;Where is The &amp;ldquo;Great Crowd&amp;rdquo; Serving God?&lt;/em&gt; This is an account of Jon&amp;rsquo;s observations and his personal research from 1980 to 1981 while serving at Brooklyn Bethel. This booklet has been included in its entirety in Appendix C.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Epilogue,&lt;em&gt; The Copyright Owner&amp;rsquo;s Story&lt;/em&gt; by Deborah Dykstra &amp;mdash; Former regular pioneer and temporary special pioneer, Deborah Dykstra tells her journey of discovering that Jehovah&amp;rsquo;s Witnesses were not the sound foundation that she thought they were, realizing instead that it is Jesus Christ himself that is the real &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; and foundation to life as a Christian. Thereafter, she shares how she embarked on a 25 year friendship with Raymond and Cynthia Franz along with anecdotal stories about the Franz&amp;rsquo; lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond Franz died in 2010, however in this re-publishing of &lt;em&gt;Crisis of Conscience&lt;/em&gt; based on it&amp;rsquo;s very last printing in 2008, the authors story, heart and expressions of his love for God and his fellow man remain with us.&lt;/p&gt;" />
