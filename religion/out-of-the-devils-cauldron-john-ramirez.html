  <title>Out of the Devils Cauldron - John Ramirez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered if Satan is real? In his book Out of the Devil&#39;s Caldron: A Journey from Darkness to Light, John Ramirez tells the story of how he was trained to be the third-ranked high priest of a satanic cult in New York City-casting powerful witchcraft spells and controlling entire spiritual regions. But what started as a long spiral into the underworld ended in a miraculous encounter with Jesus Christ that changed the course of his life. Let John Ramirez walk you through the dark alleys of this world as he uncovers the hidden secrets of darkness through his powerful testimony. People from all ethnic backgrounds dabble in the occult and fall victim to this satanic underworld, never seeing the way out. John Ramirez is one in a million who made it out.   John Ramirez&#39;s home church for the past nine years has been Times Square Church in New York, founded by David Wilkerson. John has been blessed with the opportunity not only to attend there and sit under the Word and mature spiritually, but the Lord opened the door through the security ministry to form a tight bond between him and Pastor Dave. For two and a half years John had the privilege and blessing to walk with Pastor Dave, and he became a spiritual father to John. He prayed with him, laid hands on him, and even read the manuscript of Out of the Devil&#39;s Cauldron before the book was published, giving his blessing. Pastor Dave was so touched by John&#39;s testimony that one night he brought him up on stage to have him share his story with the congregation.   In the 1950s, Pastor Dave had a young Nicky Cruz in his life. When Nicky told Pastor Dave &quot;I will cut you into a thousand pieces,&quot; through the Holy Spirit Pastor Dave said, &quot;Nicky, if you cut me into a thousand pieces, all one thousand pieces would say &#39;Jesus loves you.&#39;&quot; Many years later, David Wilkerson through the Holy Spirit said to John Ramirez, &quot;I see Jesus in you.&quot; And those words forever changed John&#39;s life, to go minister anywhere in the world. Today, John Ramirez says, &quot;Thank you, Pastor Dave, for seeing Jesus in me.&quot;   John Ramirez is a sought-out speaker by many who want to hear of his involvement in the highest levels of the occult and how he got out. He speaks at churches, schools, rallies, and conferences--both secular and Christian--and has been a featured guest on TV and radio programs. He can be reached at JohnRamirez.org." />
