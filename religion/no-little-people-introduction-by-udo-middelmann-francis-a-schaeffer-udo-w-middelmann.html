  <title>No Little People (Introduction by Udo Middelmann) - Francis A. Schaeffer, Udo W. Middelmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most Christians take an honest look at themselves and conclude that their limited talents, energy, and knowledge mean that they don&#39;t amount to much. Francis A. Schaeffer says that the biblical emphasis is quite different. With God there are no little people!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book contains sixteen sermons that explore the weakness and significance of humanity in relationship to the infinite and personal God. Each was preached by Schaeffer at L&#39;Abri Fellowship in Switzerland to the community that gathered there to work, learn, and worship together. The focus of this collection is the lasting truth of the Bible, the faithfulness of God, the sufficiency of the work of Christ, and the reality of God&#39;s Spirit in history. The sermons represent a variety of styles-some are topical, some expound Old Testament passages, and still others delve into New Testament texts. &lt;em&gt;No Little People&lt;/em&gt; includes theological sermons and messages that focus specifically on daily life and Christian practice. Each sermon is a single unit, and all are valuable for family devotions or other group study and worship. Readers will be encouraged by the value that God places on each person made in His image.&lt;/p&gt;" />
