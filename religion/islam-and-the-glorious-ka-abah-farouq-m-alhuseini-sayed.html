  <title>Islam and the Glorious Ka’Abah - Farouq M. Alhuseini, Sayed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Islam and the Glorious Kaabah&lt;/i&gt; presents a unique guide that provides the background information about Islam since the time of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him). It begins at the time when he came to Makkah and left his wife, Hajar, and his baby son, Ismael. Years later he journeys back to Makkah to meet his son who by then has grown up to be a young man, and built with him the Kaaba, which became the center-point for the Muslims around the world and it provides the direction for their prayers and worshipping Allah in a uni?ed way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Sayed / Farouq M. Al-Huseini offers a wide range of information about the religion of Islam, its teachings and fundamental beliefs, and the worshipping acts of its believers. He explains the holy book of Islam, the Quran, explaining how its revelations began and what it contains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the text includes a summary of the life of the prophet of Islam, Mohammad (peace be upon him), from his birth and early years through his receiving of the revelations and, ultimately, his prophethood. It also covers his propagation of Islam in Makkah and migration to Al Madinah, where the cradle of Islam was established. Most importantly, this guide explores his personality, his sayings, and his deeds, which have been changing the world for fourteen centuries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
