  <title>Living in His Light - David C. McDonald  D.O, Martha Kalichman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God promises that if we seek Him with all our hearts, we will find Him. Along lifes journey, He promises to keep our feet from slipping. When clouds come our way, He sends sun rays to burst through, unveiling His presence. In the midst of the clamoring world, He offers us peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God reveals Himself to each of us in His own perfect way, sometimes with subtle evidence and sometimes with His shining light. If we race ahead of Him, we may overlook these signs. Distractions of the world may take us on a path away from God, where we miss these signs. However, if we stay in step with Him, a great adventure awaits us.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Personal experiences described in &lt;em&gt;Living in His Light&lt;/em&gt; offer encouragement for those looking for the reality of our Lords never-ending presence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
