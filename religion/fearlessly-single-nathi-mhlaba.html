  <title>Fearlessly Single - Nathi Mhlaba</title>

Book Review: Fearlessly Single by Nathi Mhlaba
Society is bent on emphasizing the importance of relationships and marriage, so how can a single Christian woman cope in such a world?
Author Nathi Mhlaba has been through all of this, and it seems that she has the answers.
In her book Fearlessly Single: Diary of a Single Christian Woman, she explores the fact that women today are obsessed with getting into relationships and finding someone to marry. She also considers how difficult it is for a religious Christian woman to find an equally religious Christian man to marry.
Through anecdotes, Mhlaba explores how she went wrong in her own relationships, and her experience has given her the insight to advise other single Christian women about how they can resurrect their relationships with God. She postulates that it is more important for a single woman to discover themselves - be happy in themselves, on their own - and to become closer to God, and then the perfect relationship will follow.
Mhlaba has a sincere passion for her religion and for her newfound cause in life: to spread the word of God and encourage single women through the passages of her book, which are certain to be consoling to many of the South African women who continuously find themselves in bad relationships or feel without direction if they are alone.
She is at pains to urge Christian women to be comfortable in the now and to remember that God has a plan for everyone. They just need to have faith, and remember that being single is an opportunity for them to be themselves and a blessing from God." />
