  <title>The Question: A Survey of the Questions Asked by the World&#39;s Most Influential Leader - Jim Way, Norman Geisler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two thousand years ago, Jesus challenged the religious system of his day. It had become infiltrated with traditions and man-made practices that had nothing to do with the word of God or the Lord&#39;s intervention for his people. Many of the people with whom Jesus came in contact had doubts and were oppressed by this religious system. Jesus challenged the people of his day by asking 233 questions--more than any other leader in recorded history. 	The uniqueness of this book is threefold: First, in two thousand years, no other book has been written that summarizes these extraordinary questions. Second, the questions that Jesus asked pressed the very heart and root of the issues that were universally significant during that period. Third, these questions, the answers to these questions, and Jesus&#39;s authentic resolutions transcend time and space to the current condition of our culture today. They cover every aspect of our lives, whether we deal with the purpose of life, our relationships to one another, or how God wants to impact our conventional society. The Question builds a bridge between what Jesus said two thousand years ago and his empirical message to what we desperately need to hear today. Jesus has a unique way of communicating, inspiring us to reach down deep into our very being. His questions are piercing and challenging and cause introspection that could only be inspired by the Almighty. It is a unique and unusual process of communication created by the world&#39;s greatest leader." />
