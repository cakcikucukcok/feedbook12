  <title>The Final Rollercoaster - Desmond Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are all interested in the future, because that&#39;s where we are hoping to live. In the Bible, the 
special book about the future is the last onethe book of Revelation. It is often thought to be a 
mysterious book, but in fact it&#39;s a mosaic of over 500 Old Testament references.&lt;/p&gt; These references 
are the keys with which we may unlock the Apocalypse. Prominent in its forecasts are allusions to 
Jezebel and Elijah. Most have heard of the world&#39;s last conflict called Armageddon. But few realize 
that Armageddon cannot be understood without studying its Old Testament sourcethe histories of Ahab, 
Jezebel, Elijah at Mount Carmel, and the destruction of idolaters in the Kishon Valley (at Megiddo, 
which is the Hebrew root name for the Greek word Armageddon).&lt;/p&gt; Desmond Ford has two doctorates, and 
two of his postgraduate degrees are in eschatology. He has written 10 books on Daniel and Revelation 
and lectured in many countries on these themes. Here, Ford focuses in on future events typified by the 
Old Testament stories of Elijah versus Jezebel. Central to this study are investigation into 
Antichrist and his attacks on the latter day church. Revelation&#39;s messages for an imperiled world are 
central in this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
