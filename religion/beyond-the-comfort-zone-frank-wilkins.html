  <title>Beyond the Comfort Zone - Frank Wilkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Questions. We all have them, rattling around in the back of our minds. How did the country get to be like this? We have a government thats repeatedly paralyzed by a Congress and president constantly at odds. We have a monster bureaucracy churning out an avalanche of new medical regulations. We have a shooting war thats been going on since 9/11 a war in which our terrorist enemies have struck at nations around the globe, and might eventually acquire nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then theres the other war. In nearly every state, battles are being fought over issues which are central to the very fabric of life. Our societys basic building blocks marriage, family, the concept of morality itself have been turned into political footballs. This is a kind of war which has no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More questions. How can all this be happening? We thought that two World Wars and a four-decade Cold War had settled everything. What is it, thats turning this world into a lunatic asylum? Is there any way to make sense out of it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book isnt about questions. The symbol on the front cover says just the opposite: Its about answers. And that includes answers to the biggest question of all. This book is about the war that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
