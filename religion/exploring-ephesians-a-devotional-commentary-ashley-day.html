  <title>Exploring Ephesians  a Devotional Commentary - Ashley Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year AD 62, the Apostle Paul was a prisoner in Rome. He had been arrested in Jerusalem  on a false charge of taking Greeks into the temple. Knowing he would not receive a fair trial in Jerusalem, he had exercised his right as a Roman citizen and appealed to Caesar. Eventually, after many adventures, he arrived in Rome and awaited his hearing before Nero. During this waiting period he wrote four marvelous letters, letters which have enriched the lives of countless people down through the centuries. All four letters were recognized by the Fathers as inspired by God and were incorporated in the Scriptures. This book concentrates on Paul&#39;s letter to the Ephesians. The original recipients have long since left this world, but Gods Word is still alive and we shall examine the letter verse-by-verse, with a view to understanding what God is saying to us today." />
