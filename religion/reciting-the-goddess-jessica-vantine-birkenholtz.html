  <title>Reciting the Goddess - Jessica Vantine Birkenholtz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Reciting the Goddess&lt;/em&gt; presents the first critical study of the Svasthanivratakatha (SVK), a sixteenth-century Hindu narrative textual tradition. The extensive SVK manuscript tradition offers a rare opportunity to observe the making of a specific, distinct Hindu religious tradition. Jessica Vantine Birkenholtz argues that the SVK serves as a lens through which we can observe the creation of modern &#39;Hinduism&#39; in the Himalayas, as the text both mirrored and informed key moments in the self-conscious creation of Nepal as the &#39;world&#39;s only Hindu kingdom&#39; in the late medieval and early modern period.
Birkenholtz mines the literary historiography that is contained within the SVK text itself, chronicling the text&#39;s literary and narrative development as well as the development of the Svasthani goddess tradition. She outlines the process whereby the SVK gradually transformed into a Purana text, and became a critical source for Nepali Hindu belief and identity. She also examines the elusive character of the goddess Svasthani whose identity is tied to the pan-Hindu goddess tradition, and the representation of women in the SVK and the ways in which the text influenced local and regional debates on the ideal of Hindu womanhood. &lt;em&gt;Reciting the Goddess&lt;/em&gt; presents Nepal&#39;s celebrated SVK as a micro-level illustration of the powerful ways in which people, place, and literature intersect to produce new ideas and concepts of identity and place, even in a historically non-literate culture." />
