  <title>Daily Devotions with Jen - Jennifer Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Devotions are defined as love, loyalty, or enthusiasm for a person, activity, or group. With Gods continuous love for us, it is necessary to devote our time and energy on his teachings. Daily Devotions with Jen focuses on Gods love and compassion for our world. Through prayer and daily reminders, we are able to refocus and create a more positive mindset. These reminders offer hope and a fresh renewal of our faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me (Ps. 51:10 KJV).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When you stop and think about how much of your time is spent on worry and doubt, is there any room left for peace and optimism? It is important to take time each day to rest and refocus your mind on Gods purpose for your life. A helpful way to regain a positive outlook on your days is to read the Bible. Through scripture, we reconnect with God, his son, and the Holy Spirit. Scripture transforms our hearts and minds by opening our souls to new beginnings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? There is no searching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk, and not faint (Isa. 40:2831 KJV). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daily Devotions with Jen provides scripture, along with positive yet straightforward reminders that you are loved and never alone. Gods plan for your life is clearly written in his teachings and best followed on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (Prov. 3:56 KJV).&lt;/p&gt;" />
