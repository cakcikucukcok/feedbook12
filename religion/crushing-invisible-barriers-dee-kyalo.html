  <title>Crushing Invisible Barriers - Dee Kyalo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book has been called an eye-opener!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you do not know may be hurting you, and just because you cannot see it, it doesnt mean that it is absent. Gravity cannot be seen, but its effects cannot be argued with. Many times people think that their inability to keep a relationship or get a spouse lies in the visible reasons; while that might be true to some extent, the main reasons are invisible to the physical eye. Discover the secret to overcoming those invisible barriers that hinder and delay many individuals in their pursuit of long-lasting relationships that are intended to culminate into successful marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking book includes testimonies of people who have experienced these unseen limitations and have overcome them using the Word of God. Find out how you can exercise your faith by taking authority in the spiritual realm to enforce your liberty in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what God has promised is one thing, but knowing the steps to take to lay hold of those promises is another. The author outlines basic strategies to engage in battle and conquer the enemy of your marital destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
