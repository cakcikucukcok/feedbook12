  <title>A PRIMER ON POWER: DISCOVERING THE DYNAMIC MINISTRY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT - Scott Camp, Ron Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Primer on Power, The Power of The Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to introduce this subject in the hopes that my readers may enter into this fullness of the life of the Spirit and His ministry gifts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The liberating truth of the Holy Spirit&amp;#39;s work will set all who read it on the journey to fullness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Need The Holy Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a book about power, more specifically, this is a book about the power of the Holy Spirit and how this power dramatically impacted both the personal life and ministry of the author. It is a book written to help you and your church discover the dynamic ministry of the Holy Spirit. While this book discusses theology, it is not primarily a book on Pneumatology, but rather a personal and practical guide to life in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There are places around the world where Christians are desperate for the power of God.&amp;nbsp; They aggressively seek the presence and power of God and realize that without this power they are helpless to do the work of God. By way of contrast, the author has also stood in some of the magnificent cathedrals in Europe. At one time, these great edifices were at the center of genuine demonstrations of the power of God, but today they are museums.&amp;nbsp; There are no people and there is no power!&amp;nbsp; Many churches in America are approaching the same situation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I want to suggest that the mission of the church is unalterably linked to the work and ministry of the Holy Spirit.&amp;nbsp; Without His ministry, the church has no power and the Christian has no victory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Not Read This Book ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Unless you are Desperate for Power.&amp;nbsp; It is not for those who WANT power, but for those who MUST have power.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the power of the Holy Spirit who can dramatically change your life and your world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As a Harvest Evangelist who has traveled around the world and preached in the largest congregations in America, Dr. Scott Camp writes from first hand experience.&amp;nbsp; He has seen thousands come to Christ, their lives changed, and miraculous answers to prayer.&amp;nbsp; This &amp;quot;primer&amp;quot; is written to help you and your church discover the powerful ministry of the Holy Spirit.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Camp also describes with great transparency &amp;quot;how this power dramatically impacted both my personal life and ministry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is book for those who are desperate to see God at work through them. Scott leared these truths at great personal cost, and shares them with a desire to help other Christians experience this personal victory over sin and power for service.&amp;nbsp; He also discusses the special gift the Holy Spirit gives to each believer which becomes a catalyst to other supernatural gifts of the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;God plucked Scott Camp out of a lifestyle destined for destruction as a teen and set him on a path to following Jesus Christ.&amp;nbsp; He is an evangelist with a world wide ministry. He travels extensively throughout the United States, Eastern Europe, Mexico, South America, Pakistan and the continent of Africa preaching at churches, city-wide crusades, and conferences. He has been featured as a program guest with the Billy Graham Crusade.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Camp currently serves as the Faculty Chair of Evangelism at SUM Bible College and Theological Seminary in Oakland, CA.&amp;nbsp; He has also served as a Pastor and Church Planter.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Camp holds a Masters of Arts in Theology from Criswell College, where he graduated Summa Cum Laude.&amp;nbsp; In addition, he holds a Master of Divinity from Southwestern Assemblies of God University and a Master of Theology Degree from South-western Baptist Theological Seminary. Scott and his wife Gina, have four adult children and live in Arlington, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
