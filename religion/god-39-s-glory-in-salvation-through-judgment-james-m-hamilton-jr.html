  <title>God&#39;s Glory in Salvation through Judgment - James M. Hamilton Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Exodus 34 Moses asks to see God&amp;rsquo;s glory, and God reveals himself as a God who is merciful and just. James Hamilton Jr. contends that from this passage comes a biblical theology that unites the meta-narrative of Scripture under one central theme: God&amp;rsquo;s glory in salvation through judgment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hamilton begins in the Old Testament by showing that Israel was saved through God&amp;rsquo;s judgment on the Egyptians and the Caananites. God was glorified through both his judgment and mercy, accorded in salvation to Israel. The New Testament unfolds the ultimate display of God&amp;rsquo;s glory in justice and mercy, as it was God&amp;rsquo;s righteous judgment shown on the cross that brought us salvation. God&amp;rsquo;s glory in salvation through judgment will be shown at the end of time, when Christ returns to judge his enemies and save all who have called on his name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hamilton moves through the Bible book by book, showing that there is one theological center to the whole Bible. The volume&amp;rsquo;s systematic method and scope make it a unique resource for pastors, professors, and students.&lt;/p&gt;" />
