  <title>Saving My Family - Steve Koski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name is Steve, father and husband to an average middle-class family. Im writing this book because today my wife, son, daughter, and I are saved by the grace of God through our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Our walk to Him was not short and certainly not easy. We experienced blessings and trials that tested our very being and sanity. This book will bring you through visions, visitations, and demonic experiences that changed us forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that this book might reach someone who is looking for answers that can be found within our journey to the Lord. I pray also that this story will be an encouragement, as it reminds you that God is listening to your prayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible states,&lt;em&gt; Ephesians 6:12, for we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places. &lt;/em&gt; It is this one verse that sets up our entire story, it states the challenge my family was about to be put into, however it also is the very footing I needed to keep me based in the word of the Bible, to remember who the enemy truly was in our struggle, and to remember Jesus, who was really in control of everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have faithstrong faiththat our Lord Jesus is a man of His word, that He is able to do all, and that He does walk with you always. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours in Christ,&lt;/p&gt;
