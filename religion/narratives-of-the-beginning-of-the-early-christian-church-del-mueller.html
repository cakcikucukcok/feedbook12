  <title>Narratives of the Beginning of the Early Christian Church - Del Mueller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have been present during the period following Pentecost? Imagine being one of those who believed and was baptized on that Festive Day. Then join Peter and John as they face the wrath of the Sanhedrin. Be part of the first communion service. Witness the selection of the seven deacons. Describe the terror the hypocrites in the congregation felt after observing a pronouncement of death to Ananias and Sapphira. Ride with Philip as he interprets Isaiah for an Ethiopian official. Become, with Paul, awestruck when Jesus appears as a blinding light and challenges: Paul! Paul! Why are you persecuting me? Follow Peters instructive ministry to Cornelius and his Gentile friends. Witness Peters imprisonment and miraculous escape. Observe the events that led to the spread of the Christian Church, reaching to and beyond Antioch in Syria. 
Del Mueller takes readers into the thoughts and hearts of the key witnesses to the beginning of the Christian Church. He writes a first-person account that provides readers with a unique historical perspective of the stories as they really could have happened. Narratives of the Beginning of the Christian Church will personalize the events that altered the world and show readers the humanness of those who were changed because of Jesus." />
