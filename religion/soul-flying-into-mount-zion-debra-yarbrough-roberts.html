  <title>Soul  Flying  into  Mount  Zion - Debra Yarbrough Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prophetess Debra J. Yarbrough was prophesized to by her former Pastor that God was preparing her for translation. So there present in her Church were many eyewitnesses, when sudden death came She Departed Earth and Translated Home. It was revealed to Debra that she was not to fear death.  There she was soul flying being escorted by two Angelic Angels, Michael and Gabriel. Michael the Arch Angel spoke fiercely fear not for we have been sent from the presence of God to escort you safely into heavenly frontiers  There prophetess, Debra, was dropped-off on Top of   Mount Zion where she stood in the brightest of light, that shone out from the figurative inanimate  holy Lamb.  Why! She was saturated with liquid love pouring out of her very being.  As they continued in joint venture strolling down into the grassy green meadows where she discovered paradisiacal sightings of splendor, and beauty, beyond any sense of an imagination. There she spent forty minutes observing many profound mysteries finally being unveiled.  Then afterwards the guided tour finished.
 The holy lamb flew her swiftly away into the vast realms of the Universe And there she was shown a worldwide ministry and a greater ingathering of harvest.  Finally her departure came, flying back to the holy Mount.  Surprisingly!  The holy Lamb said, Debra you must go back to earth. Then tears began falling from her eyelids like heavy rain drops. Her heart filled with disparity. The lambs passion quickly comforted. My daughter you are given to know the mysteries of the kingdom.  Therefore, the things that you have seen and heard write in a book.  Tell my people that I love them and I have not forgotten them days without numbers.  When you see all these events began culminating LOOK UP!  My dissension is drawing near. My daughter, the greater cloud of witness have been waiting with great anticipation for this phenomenal event to finally take precedence. 
I am coming back for my Bride who has adorned herself in fine white linen unlike the spotted polka dots.  But garments that have remained unspotted from this present day World. Halleluiah!  Selah, ponder on these occurring events of time and be ready for soul shifting. Therefore, prepare for your heavenly father has kept it a guarded secret he only knows the hour of his Son Yahushuas return." />
