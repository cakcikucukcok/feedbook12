  <title>Secure Forever - Robert Metevia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a must-read for anyone seeking the assurance and peace of mind that their salvation, once received, is forever and can never be lost. It is also a must-read for those who want to defend this precious doctrine and pass along to fellow believers the truth that will set them free. No longer will it be necessary to walk on eggshells, trying to keep what only God can keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will enlighten the understanding of its readers to see that the truth of their new position in Christ is absolutely perfect before God, while their practice is fl awed. It will also reveal that Gods work of justification declares them righteous forever, while His work of sanctification makes them righteous in their behavior. A number of other theological distinctions will be made to help the readers understand the permanency of their salvation, such as the differences between salvation faith and service faith; innate knowledge and head knowledge; sinner and saint; the believers relationship with God and his fellowship with God; judicial forgiveness and parental forgiveness; and a distinction between the words &lt;em&gt;faith of Christ &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;faith in Christ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will also reveal the warfare that goes on in the minds of believers, preventing them from &lt;em&gt;going for broke &lt;/em&gt;and trusting in Christ and Christ alone for their salvation. To trust in Christ plus ones own ability to maintain a certain level of faith is not to trust in Christ alone to complete what He has started, but instead to trust in Christ plus human effort. The truth of once saved, always saved will motivate believers to serve Godnot out of a fear of losing their salvation, but out of gratitude that they are kept by Gods power to serve others and can never be lost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
