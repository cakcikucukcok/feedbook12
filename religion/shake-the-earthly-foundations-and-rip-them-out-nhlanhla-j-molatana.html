  <title>Shake the Earthly Foundations and Rip Them Out - Nhlanhla J Molatana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nhlanhla Molatana takes us on the journey that a child of God has to go through in order to receive the Fathers favour. This book is designed for you straight from heaven, in order to shake all the earths evil foundations and rip them out of your life and family. This will enable you to breathe the fresh air of heaven and know that God is alive and kicking. This book is empowered with sermons that have been preached through revelations and prayers to enable you as a child of God to be strengthened and given that boost to move to that place where you proclaim your heavenly treasures. If you heard about hunger strikes and toyi-toying before, you should take a look at what God is saying about these earthly words that have the true principles of heaven. As you start the journey, you will be transformed from being a child of this earth to a child of God who has seen the veil of darkness being lifted, truly burying the devil and pressing forward to your victories. Your journey will show you that all the beautiful dreams you had from heaven are truly your God-given destiny that you have to achieve." />
