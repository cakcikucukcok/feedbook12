  <title>Live the Life of Dreams and Visions - Bonga Thulani Ndlangamandla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IN THIS BOOK I want to talk about the life of dreams and visions. This is a very important subject in the life of a human being. So, let me start by saying this powerful statement, life is a vision and those who have the opportunity to live are sustained by dreams and visions. The first statement of the holy bible quotes that In the beginning was God. Before the foundations of the earth, He was there. He created the heavens and the earth, day and night, seasons and years, all different kinds of plants (vegetation) and animals and most importantly us (humans). In all this wonderful creation, we note that the main focus was on man who was created for the sole purpose of dominating the earth and manifesting Gods vision. Allow me to declare that God had a vision to dominate and rule in this heaven and earth that He had created. However he decided to create man and give him that mandate of manifesting His kingdom here on earth. We note that when every other living thing was created, only words were released, but with man He created them in His likeness and further breathed on him thus putting the God nature in him (see Genesis 2:7). Now I hope you understand me clearly when I say life is Gods vision. If you could take your time and study life in general, you will agree with me that any outcome of the human life has so much to do with their dreams and visions. What you are today is a result of certain actions (decisions) you have taken previously and most clearly, they relate to your dreams and visions (beliefs). This applies to every human being living under the sun. It is worth noting though that many peoples lives are controlled by the dreams and visions of others. Not that they cannot live a life of their own dreams and visions, but because of lack of knowledge and understanding of who they are and what they are capable of doing in this life. I believe the subject covered in this book is very important for everybody regardless of their age, race, skin colour, gender, background etc. This book will blow your mind and will cause you to understand who you are, what you can achieve as well as how you can achieve those dreams and visions you have for your life. It will further inform and remind you about the strongholds and pillars of unlimited success in this life. Man ought to understand that he has only one opportunity to live in this world; hence they have to fully utilize their opportunities to the maximum. You need to understand that this life is a once off gift. Physically man is born once and thereafter awaits death. Now for life to have a sense of meaning and direction there is no other way but to follow the rules that will give you the best results. If you take life as a game, you need to understand the rules of the game in order to win. So in this book we want to define life as a vision hence we will be discussing the rules of a vision thereof." />
