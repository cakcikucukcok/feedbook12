  <title>Take Your Sandals Off - Roberto Hern치ndez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many of the inhabitants of our rapidly changing world have made good look bad and bad look good. We are a society that has deviated from the Word of God, proclaiming that the Word (the Holy Bible) contradicts itself, when in reality it is our understanding and our minds that contradict themselves. Most people lack understanding and are not aware that the mysteries of God are not read but revealed by the Spirit who knows all thingspast, present, and future.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you are a leader, minister, pastor, preacher, or servant of the Lord, you will be helped in your journey to walk a holy life, a life separated from the worlds system and dedicated to the Lord God. You will learn the meaning of truly serving God. You will gain a deeper understanding of God and the purpose He has for your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Your Sandals Off reveals the mystery behind the burning bush like never before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
