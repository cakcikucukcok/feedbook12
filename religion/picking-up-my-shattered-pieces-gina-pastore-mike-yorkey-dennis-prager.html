  <title>Picking Up My Shattered Pieces - Gina Pastore, Mike Yorkey, Dennis Prager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gina Pastore&amp;#39;s life changed in an instant! She never dreamed the title of her husband&amp;#39;s book Shattered would happen to her. After all, she and Frank were childhood sweethearts whose lives unfolded like a Hollywood movie: he found fame pitching for the Cincinnati Reds; she tended to the home fires with a son and daughter. It was during Frank&amp;#39;s big league career, though, that they turned their priorities from materialism to the things in life that really matter: God, family, and integrity. When Frank retired, he went into ministry, but even such a noble pursuit had its difficulties. Then in 2004, Frank became the host of the Frank Pastore Show on KKLA, a Christian radio station in Los Angeles. His weekday program quickly became popular, leading to numerous speaking requests. And then one afternoon--while commuting home on his Honda VTX 1800 motorcycle--their lives changed forever in an instant. What follows is Gina&amp;#39;s account of the &amp;quot;rest of the story&amp;quot;--and a reminder that in times of trouble and tribulation, God calls us to persevere and trust in Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
