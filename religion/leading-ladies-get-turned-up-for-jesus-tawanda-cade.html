  <title>Leading Ladies Get Turned up for Jesus - Tawanda Cade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a woman of God you are called to be the leading ladynot lead a mediocre existence. Life will send challenges daily, but as you are molded into perfection, you will discover who you really are. It may surprise you! However, it does not matter who your parents are or where you come from. As a lady you have the opportunity to be who God says you are and not a reflection of who others proclaim you to be. Every day a leading lady should spend at least ten or fifteen minutes with her heavenly Father through sacred prayer and devotion. It will shape the foundation of your heart and allow you to live on purpose instead of just existing from day to day. Many women struggle with the basic principles of life because they are too busy with things that have no purpose and add no potential value to their lives. Five or ten years later they are searching for love in all the wrong places, when it begins with your heavenly Father and loving yourself. Only then will you truly discover life and what your purpose as a woman of God is. If you are struggling with lack of love, forgiveness, appreciation, and are confused about who you are, then this book will help transform you. Lets get turned up for Jesus and rock out this transition!&lt;/p&gt;" />
