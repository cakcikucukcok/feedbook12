  <title>God Can Turn It Around for You - Apostle Dr. Joseph Ajao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many books are out there that touched nations
with powerful impact, with biblical divine insight
and with progressive encouragement to all that
dare to read and believe. Those books spurs many
people to take positive actions about their lives.
Kudos to you all the great authors that made
it possible for the needy people to receive help
through self-help books which is the best help. Apostle, Dr. Joseph
O. Ajaos intention in this book is to bring the testimonies of the real
people that faced real problems but stood their grounds and received
breakthrough to you. Why? Because the problems did not break them
but built them up successfully. The Apostle, Dr. Joseph Olutunde
Ajao has done it again as he did in his former book that he wrote
many years ago The New Fulfi lled The Old. The proven evidence
that Jesus Christ fulfi lled the Scriptures. In his book, God can turn it
around for you. With God all things will be possible. He proved once
again that miracles have not ceased as many people believed now that
miracles have stopped happening (See: John 4:48; Mark 2:12; Luke
1:37; Jeremiah 32:27; Jeremiah 33:3; Jeremiah 1:12; Psalm 50:15;
Mark 11:22-25). He theologically, biblically and inspirationally
proved his point beyond every reasonable doubt that God can perform
His miracles in your life if you believe that the Almighty God called
Yahweh can do it right now. The promises of miracles stand forever up
till eternity by the power of the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ
more than two thousand years ago. If you read his book without
any liberal theological goggle, you shall understand and agree that
Yahweh can turn your life around for good. For with Almighty God
nothing will be impossible (See: Luke 1:37; Luke 18:27; Matthew
18:18-20; Isaiah 40:8; Isaiah 42:8; Psalm 81:10." />
