  <title>Exploring and Engaging Spirituality for Today&#39;s Children: A Holistic Approach - La Verne Tolbert, Shirley Morgenthaler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Exploring and Engaging Spirituality for Today&#39;s Children: A Holistic Approach answers questions about the most effective ways to help children, pre-teens, and teens develop spiritually. This collection of research gleaned from presentations during the Fourth Triennial Children&#39;s Spirituality Conference at Concordia University in 2012 is divided into four major sections: (1) theological and historical foundations, (2) engaging parents and congregations, (3) engaging methodologies, and (4) exploring children at risk, child pornography, social justice, intercultural diversity, and abstinence education.  Researchers acknowledge that the home is the foundation for Christian nurture. In Exploring and Engaging Spirituality for Today&#39;s Children, both scholars and ministry leaders come together with parents to promote a holistic environment where children are encouraged to love, respect, and obey God. From birth to high school, children&#39;s voices resonate throughout these studies as they are invited to share their reflections and experiences. Exploring and Engaging Spirituality for Today&#39;s Children is a lively, easy-to-read collection that reflects a broad range of faith traditions and is ideal for all those who are committed to the spiritual development of children." />
