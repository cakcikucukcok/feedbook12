  <title>A Revival of Hope in the Genuine Christ - Gary R. Goetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What in the world has gone wrong, and how will it be set right?
America is in a moral and economic crisis. Political action by itself will not reverse this moral and economic decline. In times past, Christian revivals occurred before a crisis in American history, such as the Revolutionary and the Civil War. What were the characteristics of Christian revivals in past history? Can a national revival happen again, or are we too close to the end times? Prophetic events relate in practicality to revival in the church today because the believers hope lies in the future revelation of the genuine Christ. History is repeating itself. Neo-democracy, leading to an imperial form of the continuing Roman Empire, is the rising form of government today, and it will rule at the end of the age. Arguments will be given for the identity of the genuine Christ. The order of prophetic events will be delineated leading to the genuine new age, along with the events that follow, such as the rebellion of Satan and the Great White Throne Judgment." />
