  <title>The Window - Debra E. Westmoreland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Window&lt;/em&gt;, Debra E. Westmoreland tells how she faced an unexpected family crisis that led her to trust God in a new way. While Stacey, her daughter, lay in a hospital bed in critical condition with an unknown illness, God revealed himself, granting his sustaining grace and enabling Debra to weather lifes storms and to trust God in all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Window&lt;/em&gt; reveals Gods faithfulness to Stacey during her time in the hospital, recalling how he brought back memories of different events in Staceys life that showed he did indeed have a good and perfect plan for her life. Strengthened by these insights, the family trusted God, even during the darkest times, to overcome any obstacle with his real power and presence. The sole purpose of The Window is to give God glory and to praise his name for the wonders he still performs for his children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are facing difficulties in your life--losses or illnesses or trials or setbacks--then &lt;em&gt;The Window&lt;/em&gt; can offer you the comfort of knowing that someone else has undergone similar struggles and that God has a history of reaching out to people in need with his grace and consolation. By listening to the authors personal story, you can draw sustenance from the reminder that God remains faithful to his promises, especially when you face lifes storms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
