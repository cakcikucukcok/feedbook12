  <title>Shooting Back from the Heart - Jim Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shooting Back caught my attention. Way to go, Jim Hubbard.&lt;br /&gt;
Oprah Winfrey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shooting Back is wonderful and should be supported in every way possible.&lt;br /&gt;
Hillary Rodham Clinton&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the photojournalism that is objective, and then there is the photojournalism that is purposefully provocative. Jim hubbard has found time to practice both.&lt;br /&gt;
The Washington Post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim and Shooting Back gives  us all hope.&lt;br /&gt;
Maria Shriver, NBC news&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His photos are powerful. His theme is strong and honest. Jims faith story is compelling, enabled by the grace and love of God. There is a human joy. Jim Hubbard is a very special person, and I am proud to know him. &lt;br /&gt;
Martin Sheen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Hubbards photos are a worthy continuation of the tradition of American documentary photography that has tried to give voice to the voiceless. Through his sensitivity we feel that these are people and not just a problem. &lt;br /&gt;
Peter Howe, director of photography, LIFE magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Hubbard reached a position which any photographer would envy. He has embarked on a task which is difficult and rarely lucrative. Jim spends his time in our ghettos, our poverty-filled streets. He is an artist photographing the poor, impoverished to heighten the publics awareness. Jim should serve as an example to us all.&lt;br /&gt;
US House of Representatives Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-CA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very moved and touched by your book. God has redeemed, is redeeming, the searing pain of your loss. Your story greatly encourages me.&lt;br /&gt;
Rankin Wilbourne, senior pastor, Pacific Crossroads Church, Santa Monica, California&lt;/p&gt;" />
