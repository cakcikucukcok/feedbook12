  <title>Super Spiritual Stories of a Great Grandmaster - Dr. Kauf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Then I looked him in the eyes and said. &quot;Remember this Tommy.  There is always something. If you can,t find it just know there is no such thing as bad luck or accident. All is Gods will.  There is always something. Ask God. Know always, God helps.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;   
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, I know the answer to Tommys question.  I accepted it initially without doubt.  Gods heavenly spirit flows out into us all, with the truth.  The Mystical experience will lead to the making of a new generation of Great Grandmasters.    They will be Christ bearers, to the world in the future.  Tommy must carry on.&lt;/p&gt;    
   &lt;p&gt; It was so ironic that Tommys father had been a top-notch policeman. Then Tommy had to watch his mother being killed by a policeman.    What meaning, psychic or otherwise could I get from it?  I guess the answer to that might lie in the fact that God is concerned about making our souls perfect.&lt;/p&gt;  Tommy would need to gain the faith to make his limitations become possibilities and turn his fears into unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years ago, I was training Tommys father, in martial arts and he asked me to ride with him from midnight till 8 AM. He was the only sheriffs deputy in the county, of 500 square miles, on the road.  It was not like today when you dont pull up on a dangerous situation without backup.  Bar fights, domestics, robberies, and what ever, you responded to alone.&lt;/P&gt;                      &lt;p&gt;The tactics that Tommys father used, would get him fired today.&lt;p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;We got a call that a boy had a gun and was shooting up a small town that had no police protection.  Tommys father turned on his flashers and started to respond to the call.  I could tell by the way he was driving that he was using his intuitive talents.&lt;/p&gt;  
     &lt;p&gt;All at once he hit the brakes, and pulled the car to the side of the road.  He said.  &quot;You drive.&quot;   I was not a sheriffs deputy and did not have any right to drive that vehicle.  Tommys father wouldve been fired if the Sheriff found out.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;I drove, and he meditated.  I knew Tommys father was heading for trouble not just by disobeying the rules, but also if anything went wrong, no one would believe his story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt; Tommys father would never be able to explain that he was using his sixth sense to link with the higher realms of perception, and God Almighty.
He must have read my mind.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;p&gt;He said to me.  &quot;I have to try to save that boys life!  I am receiving an energy that is higher in vibration and totally spiritual.  God Almighty has a reason for that boy to live.&quot;  He picked up my coat that was laying in the back seat and put it on, covering his uniform.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The boy was last seen on Main Street in the downtown area.  Tommys dad directed me to turn and drive towards the school.  As I did it came over the radio.  Someone shot back at the kid, from an upstairs window.  The kid ran towards the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got close to the school Tommys father jumped out of the cruiser and ran towards the playground area.  I followed on foot.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I know that most people will not believe what Im about to say.  Before the end of the story youll understand how this happened, because Tommy is so much like his dad, in reaching into the depths of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy pointed the gun at Tommys father.  Tommys father said.  &quot;Im on your side.  I come to fight the evil.&quot;  The boy raised the gun pointing it. He fired over Tommys fathers left shoulder.&lt;/P&gt;  
	&lt;p&gt;Tommys father was walking towards the kid and did not stop.  He said in a loving voice.   &quot;You got it!  Put the gun down, your safe.&quot;  Tommys father was staring into the eyes of the kid as he continued to walk towards him.
The boy handed the gun to him.  Tommys father placed his hand on the kids shoulder.  I could see the healing energy of Ki or Spirit transfer to the young boy.&lt;/P&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;We walked back to the cruiser, and the boy said, crying.  &quot;I dont know what happened. All I" />
