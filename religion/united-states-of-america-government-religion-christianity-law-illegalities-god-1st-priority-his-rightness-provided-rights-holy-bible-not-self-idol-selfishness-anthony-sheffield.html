  <title>United States of America, Government, Religion, Christianity, Law, Illegalities; God 1St Priority~ His Rightness, Provided Rights, Holy Bible; Not Self-Idol Selfishness. - Anthony Sheffield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every concerned citizen will enjoy and be very encouraged by the good and accurate historical records of the United States of America. Lies have infiltrated so vastly and so deeply into the society that even the educational institutions have become deceived and warped, so that the students are then receiving passed-down versions that are, as said, lies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folk are deceived innocently, some willingly; some know it and want it. Many folk are so busy with all the cares of life that they passively accept it. A false peace has set in, and yet it is not peace as we are so alertly observing. Values of the heart need care, as to whether they are right values, and those values are then displayed by posts of the government. Every citizen needs to know what the true historical experience and record is, what governmental structure was established in the USA, what it is all about, and how it really is and operates. Because we are all interested in the spiritual activity of life, then we will be so inspired therein. This is a very different and correct account of the real USA Government, its history, and its establishment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
