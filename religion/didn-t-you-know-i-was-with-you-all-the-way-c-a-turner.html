  <title>Didn’T You Know I Was with You All the Way? - C.A. Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meditation prompts, came about as a result of the Lord fulfilling the promise He gave to me in the book of Proverbs 24:13-14. Not long after the rededication of my commitment to serve Jesus Christ, I was gifted with His promise of wisdom with understanding. These promptings often came in the early morning hoursduring my time of communion and fellowship. I often liken these moment by moment refreshmentsas to spending time in The River of Life. His introduction of intimacy begins as a gradual stream, that journeys through chosen meadow-like valleys of insight. {&lt;i&gt;I have experienced the peace of His inviting presence, as the stirrings of a brook, which flows over smooth stones that lay in its pathway&lt;/i&gt;}. These were quiet- captivating interludes of lively conversational thoughts, which were orchestrated by His Spirit. {&lt;i&gt;It is beyond my comprehensionthat God, Who made all things, could so affectionately and purposefully lift me closer to Himself through the raising of my spiritual understanding of His ways&lt;/i&gt;}. As our time together progresses on, we eventually arrive at a place where the vastness of His thoughts are overwhelmingly endless. At such a view I am taken in and dispersed about by the breadth and length, depth and height of His love for me. God in all His Majesty and Splendor begins to personally instruct on what is to be unveiled of His treasury of hidden thoughts. {&lt;i&gt;God releases wisdom to reproduce His thoughts in the minds and hearts that hold His affection. Meditation and prompts are fruitful twins that come from the union of God and His beloved&lt;/i&gt;}. God is faithfuland is without loss in His givingso when He meets with me in the early waking hours of the morning, I know that I am especially being awakened to receive what only He can give&lt;i&gt;Selah&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
