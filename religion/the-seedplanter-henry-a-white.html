      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Seedplanter is about author Henry A. Whites love for God. The book is Whites means of sharing the truth about the Christian church and its mission. It speaks concerning Gods supremacy and of redemption. It speaks out against all religions and cults that oppose Christ. Furthermore, the book expresses its counter to many false teachings that lies within the Christian church that has crippled believers from moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Seedplanter echoes the Bible verses Galatians 1:68 that says, I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you other than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is saying that the church life should not just pass on doctrines or teachings but should sow spiritual seeds. The book also encourages readers to experience Christ as life so they can plant his righteous life into others as well. It expresses that it is our faith in Christ that makes one righteous and none other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
