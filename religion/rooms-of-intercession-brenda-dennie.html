  <title>Rooms of Intercession - Brenda Dennie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Chapter 7
Room #2
The Mummy Wrap     &lt;/b&gt;
     Intercession is exciting but not necessarily comfortable all the time.  I discovered this some years ago while praying alone in my bedroom one afternoon.  I recall so vividly kneeling at my bedside to pray as Id done in times past.  As I began praying in the Spirit the presence of God quickly filled the room.  Then I began interceding for lost souls, specifically for homosexuals.  Finally I began to pray deeper into the situation until I found myself lost in prayer.  Everything in the natural realm around me grew dim as my spiritual senses were heightened.  I knew that I was going into another room in the spirit.  Then something very frightening happened that Ill never forget as long as I live, I became one of them; the very ones for whom I was praying!  It seemed inconceivable but I knew that it was real as I began to think and feel just like a homosexual.  The way I saw things were no longer through my own eyes, but through the eyes of a homosexual.  It was a terrifying reality that I had now become someone that Id never been before!
     As the door to this room was shut behind me, I wanted to scream.  I desperately wanted to run and quickly get out but the Lord had other plans.  As a homosexual, initially I did not think of myself any differently than anyone else.  The thought never occurred to me that my lifestyle was abnormal until I began to hear voices in the air.  These voices were all around me declaring the love of God and the truth of His Word.  I listened very intently. At the outset the truth seemed as though it was piercing through my soul like a sharp arrow but soon it melted into my spirit like a soothing salve.  Although my mind wanted to resist I knew deep within my heart that the things that I heard were true.  
     As I kept listening I began to understand Gods message to me.  The picture became clearer and clearer.  Then the reality suddenly hit me, I WAS NOT BORN THIS WAY! Somehow I knew that the sexual lifestyle that I had chosen was perverted and displeasing to the God who created me.  He is pure, holy and all righteous.  He wondrously made me as a precious vessel of great value in His sight.  He is the Creator of every beautiful thing upon the earth and He has never made a mistake.  
     As the truth continued to penetrate my heart I became utterly appalled because I realized that I had been deceived all this time by the great Deceiver, Satan himself.   Finally I knew that I had to make some changes.  I made no excuses; I was ready to do the will of God.  So for the very first time I began my pursuit to break free from this repulsive lifestyle.  When I took the first step forward to break free, I remember trying to move my arm, but could not.  Then I tried to move my legs but it was as though I was completely paralyzed.  Finally I looked down at myself and was absolutely shocked!  My body was totally confined in a mummy-like wrapping of thick chains extending from my neck to my feet.  This wrapping about my body prohibited me from moving any part of my body.  I felt like a helpless prisoner trapped in my own body.  No matter what I tried to do, I could not break free.  I did everything that I could think of, but it was to no avail.  It was as though someone had locked me up and thrown away the key.  The terror that I felt in my heart at that moment was like an indescribable nightmare.
     While in this room of intercession it seemed as though I had been squirming under the mummy wrap for days upon days, trying to get out.  Although I had a desire to be free, I could not get out.  My head was the only part of my body that was mobile.  I just couldnt understand why I could not get out.  As I continued to squirm and try to twist my way out, I began to feel great pressure in my mind.  The tremendous frustration and unrest within me intensified as I kept trying to free myself from this entrapment of horror.  It seemed as though everything was" />
