  <title>The Kingdom of Heaven Within the Holy Book of the Great Invisible Spirit ? - Sanetha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The spiritual subject of past lives and reincarnation is highly controversial. Most religions don&#39;t believe it, and science cannot prove it yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an energy healing communication with a DNA surprise, assisting you to integrate and understand the deep-seated truths about who you are and where you came from. The information explains what is happening to us, the earth, and the universe, and what one needs to do to adapt to the new energies on the planet at this time and for the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These pages contain a profound message with the new energya message that I have delivered many times over my many lifetimes. Who am I? and Where do I come from? are questions that have been on the minds of everyone since the beginning. These thoughts are imprinted in our basic DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I became aware of who I was in the previous lifetime just before this one (less than five months between lives)my newfound identity propelled me into the search for the answers to the questions gnawing at my soul. Each answer provided new questions, leading me down the enlightened path to an encounter with the Grand Divine Plan, delivering a message of peace and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have gifts and abilities unimaginable, ready for anyone who walks through the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My search brought me into an awareness of knowing many of my past lives. It also revealed that my purpose of discovering was not about who I was, but that I would write about past lives and reincarnation at a time on the planet when this information would be so needed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
