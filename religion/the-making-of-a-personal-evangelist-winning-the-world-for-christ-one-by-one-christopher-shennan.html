  <title>The Making of a Personal Evangelist: Winning the World for Christ - One By One - Christopher Shennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Making of a Personal Evangelist, as the title suggests, is more about becoming an evangelist than it is about the method employed. Jesus told us that if we follow Him He will make us to become fishers of men - He would transform us into evangelists. The Making of a Personal Evangelist is a course that lays out the life principles, that if followed, will transform men and women into evangelists even before they adopt a method. The method subsequently just becomes the tool to get the job done. This is not a book for the casual student. Both teacher and student need to be serious about reaching the lost, and about submitting to the process of becoming what they may not initially feel qualified to be. It is about allowing Jesus Christ to make them into fishers of men. For those who are willing to accept the challenge, this book will doubtless be of inestimable value." />
