  <title>Letters to Laodicea - John E. Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Evangelical Christians have a long and influential history in the United States.  In recent decades modern culture has penetrated the evangelical community causing it to stray far from its roots.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Letters to Laodicea: A Call to Repentance for Evangelical America grew out of an Internet dialogue between author John E. Hartman and his son concerning the deep decline in evangelical churches in America and the collapse of Western culture generally. Hartmans work opens the eyes of many who do not realize what is happening to the evangelical community. Learn some of the reasons we are losing our message and the spiritual vitality central to spiritual maturity. Discover how evangelicals are committing spiritual adultery in their deepening love affair with the world. Many have exchanged the gospel for therapy and a compromised message with little authority, life, and power.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a way out of the ongoing collapse in a lifestyle of repentance and a return to basic spiritual and life disciplines. The possibility of presenting the gospel witness to a culture dying from within and facing enormous problems it cannot resolve hangs in part on what happens to the American evangelical community. Letters to Laodicea: A Call to Repentance for Evangelical America opens the door to a new level of Christian spirituality and ministry opportunity for those willing to meet the challenge to look deeper and make radical spiritual change in a time of turmoil, mixed with the potential for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
