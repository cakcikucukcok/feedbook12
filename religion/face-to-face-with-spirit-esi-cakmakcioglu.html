  <title>Face to Face with Spirit - Esi Cakmakcioglu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FACE TO FACE WITH SPIRIT tells the extraordinary journey of an architect whose work took her all over the globe and whose projects included designs for private clients, governments and royalty. But her horizons expanded even further when she became a medium.  From drawing portraits of those in Spirit, to discovering the healing power inherent in us all, to understanding how the emotional lives and belief systems of families can affect generation after generation, this voyage took her to even more exotic locations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Esis journey, told with humour and the touching stories of people she helped, reveals how her experiences freed her from the belief that we have no choices in our livesthat we are randomly born to certain families and societies, we grow up, and then die. Instead, her journey led her to a completely new way of looking at Life. FACE TO FACE WITH SPIRIT will encourage you, too, to start questioning old habits and ideas, and find the knowledge that will bring new meaning and self-empowerment into your own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just as I started to think that my adventurous life was finally settling down, a completely unplanned and most astonishing journey began, taking me to a place of wisdom and wonder. I was introduced to the world of the Spirit, but that was just the beginning!" />
