  <title>Love Doesn’T Die - Angela Brent-Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Doesnt Die&lt;/i&gt; presents an inspiring, spiritually enriched memoir of life in Jamaica. Author Angela Brent-Harris celebrates her fathers eccentric life in Jamaica along with the lives of the rest of her family. She focuses mainly on her relationship with her father, delving into what it was like growing up in Jamaica, in all of its natural beauty and laid-back lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner peace from the shared experiences and warm memories that Angela enjoyed with her father comes shining through as she lovingly relates events from her childhood. Whether reminiscing about her fathers love of jazz and the many concerts that he promoted or basking in her memories of time spent with her family just hanging out, Angela conveys a feeling of family warmth and compassion in &lt;i&gt;Love Doesnt Die&lt;/i&gt;. She recalls the comfort, purity of love, family values, and spirituality that were so ingrained in her family life. Her family is a loving example of what happens when a family really works at being a family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Doesnt Die&lt;/i&gt; offers an inspiring perspective on life as lived by a family headed by strong and loving parents who never lose sight of the impact their positive examples will have on their childrens lives long after they are gone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
