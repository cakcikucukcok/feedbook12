  <title>The Innermost Place - Nicole Bento McGhee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During our Christian walk, we learn the importance of prayer and reading the Bible. Many people have been successful with their devotional times without much guidance, but for the rest of us it is overwhelming, clumsy, and difficult to manage. Therefore, we might feel discouraged in our relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book offers a guide to developing personal devotional time. But as the process becomes more familiar and comfortable, you will develop your own style. There is no system or method that works better than others. What is written here is designed to give insight, understanding, and aid in developing a new habit. The five basic components I propose are essential for your personal devotion time: listen to music, pray, read the Bible, journal, and close in prayer. These basic components of devotional time are essential in gaining an understanding of who God is and how we can hear from Him and therefore become a follower of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the question How do I know when God is speaking to me? is found in your worship of Him with others in the church and in your personal devotions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
