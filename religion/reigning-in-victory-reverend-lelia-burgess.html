  <title>Reigning in Victory - Reverend Lelia Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book Reigning In Vicory will encourage the readers that inspite of issues and challenges they face in life they can still Reign In Victory. It requires a mindset and a determined spirit to make a difference in life. Reigning In Victory does not mean that on this journey of life we will not have troubles, problems, disappointments, trials, persecution and set backs in our lives. However, inspite of all the issues and challenges that ones life maybe confronted with it is not what happen to you that really matters but what really matters is the way you handle what happen to you. The way we think has a lot to do with the way we live. If you think you can do a thing, then you can do it. Also, if you think you can&#39;t do a thing you will eventually talk yourself out of even trying to complete the task. If your thinking is not in line with fulfilling your God given purpose you will most likely settle for existing instead of thriving to be all that God wants you to be and enjoying this abundant life that we have been given. Reigning in Victory will require one to live on purpose to complete the assignments given unto us by God to be world changers and make a difference in the lives of people everywhere. This all begins when one change the way they think and then their whole world around them changes. Learn to see the glass as half full instead of seeing it as half empty. The way you think and your attitude will determine your altitude. This book encourges the reader to do just that. I can do all things through Christ which strengthers me. That is my mindset and I want to help others to change the way they think and Reign In Victory." />
