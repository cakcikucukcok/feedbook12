  <title>3Story Participant&#39;s Guide - Dave Rahn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;You have a story to tell. Maybe you didn&#39;t realize that. When you decided to follow Jesus, your story really started to develop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;God has a story to tell. Since before you were born, God has been pursuing you. He sent his son for you—and your friends.&amp;nbsp;Your friends have stories. Maybe their stories don&#39;t include Jesus—yet. That&#39;s where you and&amp;nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;3Story&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;come in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Evangelism is an essential element of every youth group. But when traditional evangelism methods prove awkward, ineffective, or uncomfortable for students to embrace, it’s almost impossible to equip your students to understand and share their faith. But 3Story® is different. 3Story is a way of life that guides followers of Christ to BE good news while telling stories of THE Good News. Based squarely on relationships, 3Story focuses God’s story, my story (the student), and their story (their friends). This curriculum course based on Youth for Christ’s 3Story training presents an interactive learning experience that equips students to live and practice the 3Story lifestyle—a biblically based, culturally relevant form of discipleship-evangelism that emphasizes being real in personal interactions.&lt;/P&gt;" />
