  <title>When Is It Right to Die? - Joni Eareckson Tada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More and more people who are terminally ill are choosing assisted suicide. &lt;em&gt;When is it Right to Die?&lt;/em&gt; offers a different path with alternatives of hope, compassion, and death with real dignity. Joni Eareckson Tada knows what it means to wrestle with this issue and to wish for a painless solution. For the last 50 years she has been confined to a wheelchair and struggled against her own paralysis. And she sat by the bedside of her dying father, thinking, &lt;em&gt;So much suffering, why not end it all quickly, painlessly? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The terminally ill, the elderly, the disabled, the depressed and suicidal, can all be swept up into this movement of self-deliverance. Skip the suffering. Put a quick end to merciless pain and mental anguish. These are tempting enticements to the hurting. Joni doesn&amp;rsquo;t give pat answers. Instead, she gives warm comfort from God and practical help to meet the realities for those facing death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Is It Right to Die&lt;/em&gt; tells the stories of families who have wrestled with end-of-life questions and found that death with dignity does not necessarily mean three grams of Phenobarbital in the veins. Behind every right-to-die situation is a family. A family like yours. In her warm, personal way, Joni takes the reader into the lives of families and lets them speak about assisted suicide. What they say is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you have a dying family member, facing moral and medical choices, or struggling with a chronic condition that feels overwhelming, this book will help you find practical encouragement and biblical advice to help you make difficult decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is revised and updated to examine the current events, trending issues, and the rising acceptance of assisted suicide in this country.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
