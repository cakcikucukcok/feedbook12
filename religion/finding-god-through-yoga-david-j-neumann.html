  <title>Finding God through Yoga - David J. Neumann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paramahansa Yogananda (1893&amp;ndash;1952), a Hindu missionary to the United States, wrote one of the world&#39;s most highly acclaimed spiritual classics, &lt;i&gt;Autobiography of a Yogi&lt;/i&gt;, which was first published in 1946 and continues to be one of the best-selling spiritual philosophy titles of all time. In this critical biography, David Neumann tells the story of Yogananda&#39;s fascinating life while interpreting his position in religious history, transnational modernity, and American culture. Beginning with Yogananda&#39;s spiritual investigations in his native India, Neumann tells how this early &quot;global guru&quot; emigrated to the United States in 1920 and established his headquarters, the Self-Realization Fellowship, in Los Angeles, where it continues today. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preaching his message of Hindu yogic philosophy in a land that routinely sent its own evangelists to India, Yogananda was fueled by a religious nationalism that led him to conclude that Hinduism could uniquely fill a spiritual void in America and Europe. At the same time, he embraced a growing belief that Hinduism&#39;s success outside South Asia hinged on a sincere understanding of Christian belief and practice. By &quot;universalizing&quot; Hinduism, Neumann argues, Yogananda helped create the novel vocation of Hindu yogi evangelist, generating fresh connections between religion and commercial culture in a deepening American religious pluralism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
