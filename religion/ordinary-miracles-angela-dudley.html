  <title>Ordinary Miracles - Angela Dudley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We walk to God, how wondrous our task,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple truth, no questions left to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walk to God, an awesome holy thing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our open hearts are all were asked to bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ordinary Miracles&lt;/i&gt; is an oxymoron in a world where peace seems unreliable and prayers seem unanswered. But what if the real world exists where miracles are the norm? Miracles of joy and forgiveness always occur within our minds, and their external form may or may not be apparent to us. However, since miracles always come from love, they always offer an inner experience of bliss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The love that causes miracles is only ordinary because it is always present within us. Miracles are ordinary because they are our true nature, not a bonus that was earned by someone &lt;i&gt;extra&lt;/i&gt;-ordinary. No matter how successfully weve hidden our inner spark of love, it remains with us, always the truth of who we are, always awaiting our consent to offer miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poetry of &lt;i&gt;Ordinary Miracles &lt;/i&gt;is the authors response to the inner Voice for God, what she calls the Holy Spirit. Inspired by A COURSE in MIRACLES, these poems celebrate the truth that we always have a choice: to invest ourselves in thoughts of kindness rather than criticism, happiness rather than sorrow. But whatever we choose, we cannot change the magnificent reality of what we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poems are written as an acknowledgment that the Voice for God offers a very personal relationship with each of us. The Voice for God is always patient, always answers, always loves us, and to our little effort adds the strength of God. In the COURSE, Jesus reminds us, Love waits on welcome, not on time  (Text, chapter 13)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profound journey we each make is to that place within where God patiently awaits our certain return.&lt;/p&gt;" />
