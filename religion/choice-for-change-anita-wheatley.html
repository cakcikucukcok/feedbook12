  <title>Choice for Change - Anita Wheatley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted somebody to rescue you? Someone to understand the pain embedded deep within the surface of your soul? Someone to recognize that the emotions tumbling within you are not part of some sitcom to laugh at? As we set sail on this journey together through my various troubled waters, I pray you will rid yourself of unwanted baggage and make a choice for change in your lifes course, correcting those areas that will be honoring to Him. Discover that only by His guidance can we find strength and wisdom to undertake our daily tasks. Your lifes journey is your own. It cant be duplicated by anyone else. Learn how to persevere during difficult times by enlisting biblical principles. Only He can spiritually refresh our souls. I challenge you to make a choice for change to reflect more of Him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choice for Change is not so much a description of real-life problems, but a prescription for real-life, scripturally based solutions. &lt;br /&gt;
Pastor George Bryson, author of The Five Points of Calvinism, The Dark Side of Calvinism: The Calvinist Caste System, and Grace: Gods Riches at Christs Expense&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading Anitas first book, I found myself on a journey that felt like my own in more ways than I care to admit. The best sign of a great work is when it relates to the millions of readers picking it up. Anita has done just that. I highly recommend this book to everyone and dont give it away to a friend in need, rather buy them a copy. This book is a great reminder of the Lords footprints in the sand during our toughest times. &lt;br /&gt;
Philip N. Rogone, author of The Gettysburg Ghosta love story, The Princess Frog, and soon-to-be-released Resurrection&lt;/p&gt;" />
