      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sent Seeking the Orphans of God&lt;/em&gt; is for anyone concerned about how to participate with God in sowing the gospel and reaping the harvest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Many books on missional living describe how to form missional communities and the people within them, but this book goes beyond this to describe how a missional community does relational evangelism together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It provides small group Bible studies and activities at the end of each chapter, introduced through online video interviews with experienced evangelists. These activities facilitate dialogue and discernment about how to approach the task of relational evangelism amongst your relatives and friends. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Plus, there are two supplementary bonus resources included in this book.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;RENEW Love Life Communities: an eight week small group Bible study designed to enable the formation of a team who engages in relational evangelism within your congregation or church planting team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;RENEW Missional Leadership: ten devotions for congregational leaders designed to set up a structure for making disciples who make disciples and facilitate training and support for the church to reap and receive the harvest&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Believers feeling confused or apathetic about reaping the harvest will discover here a practical resource which is an encouragement to see, hear and become involved in what God is already up to in people&amp;rsquo;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dean Eaton is a faithful guide who gives us concrete ways to join God in helping to bring people into God&amp;rsquo;s family in everyday kind of ways.
