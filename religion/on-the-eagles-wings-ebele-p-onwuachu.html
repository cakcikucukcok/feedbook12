&lt;p&gt;This book outlines the principles that individuals must pay attention to in order to make a wise choice in critical moments when they are faced with a difficult decision. It also exposes common pitfalls that could make situations worse if they are not carefully avoided, like making hasty decisions. When an individual is faced with dilemma, if the person is not strong in the Lord, he or she can easily be blown about by every wind of doctrine, easily deterring one from reaching his goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Eagles Wings&lt;/i&gt; can be used as a point of reference by anyone going through difficult times or facing having to make a life-altering decision. This book is written based on biblical facts and references, as well as on true stories shared by Christians who have lived through hard times and have now shared the experiences that helped to ground them in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People go through different challenges in life. The most important thing while going through these trials is not so much the challenge itself, but instead how each individual tackles the situationthis is what makes the difference and grants the person victory. As Christians, we know that our faith is rooted in the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
