  <title>Mentoring Winners - Apostle Carlos H. L贸pez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I would recommend Mentoring Winners to all those who are called as Apostolic fathers in the faith to mentor this and future generations, working together in manifesting our Lords Kingdom on the earth this hour.  
Apostle, Dr. Joseph D. Askins, Jr.
President Living Faith Ministries, Inc.
Chancellor  Wagner Leadership Institute Northeast
Leaders, dont miss it, these truths will change your life. The bible says we have many teachers but few fathers. Church, there is a father in the house with Apostle Carlos. I highly recommend it.
Apostle, Dr. Darryl Webb
CEO/Owner at, Global Financial
Florida Area, Financial Services 
Mentoring Winners is for the young and old alike. Its never too late or early to be a leader and a great place to start is with Mentoring Winners. Being a protg myself, I understand what it is to be mentored.
Josiah David Santiago (Teenager)
Grandson and New Generation protg, 
Paul and Silas Ministries
As a representative of the Christian International Global Network (founded by Bishop, Dr. Bill Hamon) and director of CIGN - Mexico I am always interested in raising up the next generation to fulfill their potential and prophetic destiny.  Thats what Ive dedicated my life to doing as I travel in ministry throughout Latin America.  Bishop Hamon, has drilled into all of us the need to reproduce reproducers who reproduce reproducers.  Thats another way of saying mentoring. Apostle Carlos Lpez is a man uniquely qualified to write this book.  He is an effective natural father as well as a spiritual father.
