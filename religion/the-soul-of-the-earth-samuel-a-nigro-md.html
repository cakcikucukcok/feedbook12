  <title>The Soul of the Earth - Samuel A. Nigro Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;SOUL OF THE EARTHby Samuel A. Nigro, MD&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    SOUL OF THE EARTH--by Samuel A. Nigro, MD is the accumulation of what was learned over 70 plus years of life, over 45 years of marriage, over 40 years as a
    psychiatrist, 3 years in the U.S. Navy Submarine Service, and as a first generation American with five children and ten grandchildren.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The planet and mankind are amazing. To limit ourselves to behaviors as if there is nothing more, is contradicted by an accurate comprehensive understanding
    of the planet and the universe. Basically, love is superior to all and the universe is the entropy necessary for the expression of love. Love itself
    requires there to be more. Nothing more is a cruel joke that life and love are meaningless. All logic and reason demand there be more, and we should act
    as if there is even much more love in anticipation. And if there isnt, then there ought to be! Regardless, the world would be better by believing in such
    and acting as such.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The book provides some articles but most of it is the way to live a transcendental life: organized matter sanctified and given a soul by identity, truth,
    oneness, good and beauty for everyones life, liberty, and pursuit of happinesspartially the subtitle of the book. You get substance and the
    transcendental principles for living that save by actuality for a change. This is in contrast to the virtual reality culture of the unreliable
    manipulating self-discrediting noisy glitzy press&amp;media imposed substanceless non-being which, by suggestibility, turns us into choiceless aliens
    instead of free persons for the planet. By the self-worshiping self-discrediting press&amp;media, we are on the madman road-rage race to the bottom culture
    of pollution, disgust, death, and decline. Not by this book.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Against vulgar suggestibility and glitz caused gullibility, this book gives real being by teaching six analogous ways of living the wisdom-filled eight
    categories of metaphors of love in the cone of space-time:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a human particle by elementary physicsevent, spectrum, field, quantum, singularity, dimension, uncertainty, and force.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a human being by community universalsdignity, unity, integrity, identity, spirituality, life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a C/catholic, Roman or otherwise, by the sacramentsBaptism, Penance, Holy Communion, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, Matrimony, and Grace.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a Christian by the virtuesfaith, hope, charity, prudence, justice, courage, temperance, and holiness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a patient by the universal variables of all therapyliving things are precious, selective ignoring, subdued spontaneity non-self excluded, affect
    assistance, detached warmth &amp; gentleness, non-reactive listening, C2CC centered candidness, and peace &amp; mercy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    And  as sanctified by the last words of the crucified Christ.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Take your pick or combine them all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Except for the quantity, it is simple. Thousands of aphorisms and concepts about every imaginable topic are offered to teach ancient secrets from nature
    and natures God (to quote the Founding Fathers of America). The book SPIRITUALIZES our contemporary materialist culture by an audacious free-spirited
    sacramentalization of everything.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Read it through once; then a few pages or a chapter daily; and problem-solve as needed by index and perusal. You will be better. The world will be better.
    You will learn to be a real human being for everyone. And you will have your soul back by embracing the universal Mass mantra:
    life-sacrifice-virtue-lovehumanity-peace-freedom-death.
