  <title>Reflections from the Marriage Table: Our Experiences of Love in Marriage, Family, and Ministry - Ron Clark, Lori Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the midst of hectic and fast paced families, one stable element that can bring grace, love, and joy is the table. Biblically, the table was a place of mercy, unity, and hospitality. Marriage also is a uniting of male and female, to complement and partner, to create a new family, ministry, and community. When the marriage table becomes a central element, sacred and safe spaces are created for individuals, couples, and families to thrive and mature as God intended. Ron and Lori Clark share their experiences as a couple in ministry, working with family violence, and creating safe spaces for their marriage and children to mature and develop healthy self-esteem. This book, with discussion questions, is designed to help couples find partnership, peace, and grow together in relationship and love, whether in ministry or simply seeking to be who God called them to be." />
