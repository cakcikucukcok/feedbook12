  <title>God, Adam, and You: How Original Sin, the Flesh, and Holiness Integrate in the Christian Life - Michael M. Christensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Barna research suggests just over half of Americans who profess to be transformed by Christ believe God expects them to be holy and only a third consider themselves to be holy. This is disconcerting. Many of these same believers hold that Adam&#39;s sin and overwhelming fleshly desires are at the root of their personal sins. The purpose of this book is to re-examine Adam&#39;s legacy, the flesh, what sin really is, and God&#39;s holiness expectations of us. Do Adam&#39;s sin and fleshly desires force every person on this earth to sin in his likeness? Is sinning daily in thought, word, and deed our highest expectation? Can we love God in such a way that we can consistently obey his commands? We will discover that the impediments to a holy life may be fewer than we think and that what God commands of us we really can do!" />
