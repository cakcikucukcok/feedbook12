  <title>A Layman’S Commentary Volume 5 - John Devine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In todays world, it can be difficult to maintain your faith. Those seeking a greater understanding of the Bible have numerous excellent theological commentaries available to them, but due to volume and depth, many of these are out of reach of laypeople. Others lose contact with the Bible, because it no longer seems relevant to life. They use a superficial knowledge of science and evolution to exclude God and faith from their experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laymans Commentary: Volume 5Books of the Gospels presents a passage-by-passage explanation of the four books of the Bible, known as the Gospels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fifth volume, author John Devine covers the biblical records of the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. In a coordinated approach to the four accounts he emphasises the significance of the claims that confirm Jesus as the Son of God and means of securing eternal life for those who recognise him as Savior and Lord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence shows that Jesus is the most relevant person in history and why it is vital for each individual to make an informed decision about him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From personal experience Devine lays out the basis for a full and rewarding relationship with God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study aids on prophecies, parables, miracles, healings and harmony of the Gospels are also provided. &lt;/p&gt;" />
