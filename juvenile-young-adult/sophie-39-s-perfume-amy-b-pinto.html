  <title>Sophie&#39;s Perfume - Amy B. Pinto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sophie was a little girl who loved to look at her mommy&#39;s perfume bottles. Each bottle was different-unique and beautiful in its&#39; own way. She especially loved the round bottle with the little glass top that was filled with golden perfume. Mommy always warned her that she was not to touch &quot;big ladies&#39;&quot; things.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sophie wanted so much to obey her mother, but wouldn&#39;t it be nice if she could smell pretty like her sister? Maybe Avery, a little boy in her class would want to take her to the theater, like Daddy takes Mommy. Well, one day, Sophie tried so very hard to listen to her mother, but........&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;before her mind could know what her hands were doing....&lt;br&gt;
before her eyes could see what her mind was thinking,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sophie took Mommy&#39;s perfume to school one day and the Morning Glory School will never be the same! &lt;/p&gt;" />
