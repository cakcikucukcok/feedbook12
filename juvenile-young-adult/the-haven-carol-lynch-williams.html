  <title>The Haven - Carol Lynch Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the teens at The Haven, the outside world, just beyond the towering stone wall that surrounds the premises, is a dangerous unknown. It has always been this way, ever since the hospital was established in the year 2020. But The Haven is more than just a hospital; it is their home. It is all they know. Everything is strictly monitored: education, exercise, food, and rest. The rules must be followed to keep the children healthy, to help control the Disease that has cast them as Terminals, the Disease that claims limbs and lungs--and memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Shiloh is different; she remembers everything. Gideon is different, too. He dreams of a cure, of rebellion against the status quo. What if everything they&#39;ve been told is a lie? What if The Haven is not the safe place it claims to be? And what will happen if Shiloh starts asking dangerous questions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powerful and emotional, &lt;i&gt;The Haven&lt;/i&gt; takes us inside a treacherous world in which nothing is as it seems. &quot;Imagine Anna Quindlen or Sue Miller turning her attention to writing a young adult novel, and you have an idea of what Carol Lynch Williams has done for early teen readers.&quot; (Audrey Couloumbis, author of the Newbery Honor Book &lt;i&gt;Getting Near to Baby)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
