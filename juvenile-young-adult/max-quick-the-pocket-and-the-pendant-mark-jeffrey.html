  <title>Max Quick: The Pocket and the Pendant - Mark Jeffrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Max Quick is a pickpocket, a vagabond, an orphan, and a thief. Even so, nothing about him seems particularly special . . . until one day when time mysteriously stops. Suddenly, nearly everyone in the world is frozen in time&amp;#8212;except for Max.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Max must journey across America to find the source of the Time-stop. Along the way, he meets others who aren&#39;t suspended in time, like Casey, a girl who&#39;s never been on her own until now. Together, as they search for the cause of this disaster, Max and his companions encounter ancient mysteries, magic books, and clues to the riddle of stopped time. But relentless and mysterious villains are hot on Max&#39;s heels and will do everything in their power to prevent Max from ending the Time-stop. And the closer Max gets to the answers, the more it seems that his own true identity is not what he once believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racing against a clock that no longer ticks, Max must embrace his past to save his future&amp;#8212;and the world&amp;#8212;from being altered forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
