      <meta name="description" content="Lawrence is a little boy who developed an unbreakable bond with his grandmother when she first held him in the neonatal intensive care unit on the day he was born. Grandma spoiled him, made his favorite treats, and covered for him when he broke things. She taught him the alphabet, colors, and his first words. And when Lawrence grew old enough to go to school, his grandmother stayed home and did the same for Christina, his little sister. 
One day, Lawrence comes home to find that Grandma is not there. Theres no snack on his placemat at the table and no sign of Grandma anywhere. Lawrence hopes his grandma will come home soon and give him a big hug and kiss. However, instead of Grandma there are family members hes never met before and whispers that Grandma is gone, and no one will ever see her again. 
The death of a loved one can be difficult for anyone, but especially so for a child. Join Lawrence as he shares the story of his grandmothers life and learns to heal after losing her." />
