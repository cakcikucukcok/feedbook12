  <title>Don&#39;t Ever Change - M. Beth Bloom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eva has always wanted to write a modern classic&amp;#8212;one that actually appeals to her generation. The only problem is that she has realized she can&amp;#39;t &amp;#34;write what she knows&amp;#34; because she hasn&amp;#39;t yet begun to live. So before heading off to college, Eva is determined to get a life worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Eva&amp;#39;s life encounters a few unexpected plot twists. She becomes a counselor at a nearby summer camp&amp;#8212;a job she is completely unqualified for. She starts growing apart from her best friends before they&amp;#39;ve even left for school. And most surprising of all, she begins to fall for the last guy she would have ever imagined. But no matter the roadblocks, or writer&amp;#39;s blocks, it is all up to Eva to figure out how she wants this chapter in her story to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of E. Lockhart, David Levithan, and Rainbow Rowell, &lt;em&gt;Don&amp;#39;t Ever Change&lt;/em&gt; is a witty, snarky, and thought-provoking coming-of-age young adult novel about a teen who sets out to write better fiction and, ultimately, discovers the truth about herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
