      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Book Two of the bestselling Lux series&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being connected to Daemon Black sucks...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon&#39;s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection. So I&#39;ve sworn him off, even though he&#39;s running more hot than cold these days. But we&#39;ve got bigger problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something worse than the Arum has come to town...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Department of Defense is here. If they ever find out what Daemon can do and that we&#39;re linked, I&#39;m a goner. So is he. And there&#39;s this new boy in school who&#39;s got a secret of his own. He knows what&#39;s happened to me and he can help, but to do so, I have to lie to Daemon and stay away from him. Like that&#39;s possible. Against all common sense, I&#39;m falling for Daemon. Hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then everything changes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ve seen someone who shouldn&#39;t be alive. And I have to tell Daemon, even though I know he&#39;s never going to stop searching until he gets the truth. What happened to his brother? Who betrayed him? And what does the DOD want from them--from me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one is who they seem. And not everyone will survive the lies...&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the entire bestselling series!&lt;br&gt;#1: Obsidian (from Katy&#39;s point of view)&lt;br&gt;#2: Onyx (from Katy&#39;s point of view)&lt;br&gt;#3: Opal (from Katy&#39;s point of view)&lt;br&gt;#4: Origin&lt;br&gt;#5: Opposition&lt;br&gt;Oblivion (Books 1-3 from Daemon&#39;s point of view) CAN BE READ FIRST OR AFTER KATY&#39;S POV!&lt;br&gt;Prequel: Shadows (Dawson&#39;s story)&lt;/p&gt;" />
