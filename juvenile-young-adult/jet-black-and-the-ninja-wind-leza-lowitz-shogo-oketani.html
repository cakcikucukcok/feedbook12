  <title>Jet Black and the Ninja Wind - Leza Lowitz, Shogo Oketani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;**Winner of the 2013-2014 Asian/Pacific American Award for Young Adult Literature**&lt;BR&gt;**2015 Sakura Medal Nominee**&lt;BR&gt;**Shortlisted for the 2014 SCBWI Crystal Kite Award**&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Seventeen-year-old Jet Black is a ninja. There&#39;s only one problem&amp;#151;she doesn&#39;t know it.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jet has never lived a so-called normal life. Raised by her single Japanese mother on a Navajo reservation in the Southwest, Jet&#39;s life was a constant litany of mysterious physical and mental training. For as long as Jet can remember, every Saturday night she and her mother played &quot;the game&quot; on the local mountain. But this time, Jet is fighting for her life. And at the end of the night, her mother dies and Jet finds herself an orphan&amp;#151;and in mortal danger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fulfilling her mother&#39;s dying wish, Jet flies to Japan to live with her grandfather where she discovers she is the only one who can protect a family treasure hidden in her ancestral land. She&#39;s terrified, but if Jet won&#39;t fight to protect her world, who will? Stalked by bounty hunters and desperately attracted with the man who&#39;s been sent to kill her, Jet must be strong enough to protect the treasure, preserve an ancient culture and save a sacred mountain from destruction.&lt;/div&gt;" />
