She was born and raised in Hobbema, Alberta Canada, A Louis Bull First Nations member of the Four Reserves in Hobbema. Shes dedicating this to her First Nations People, her community, her family and the children in all the Schools &amp; Head Starts.  Also recognizing Late Debbie Morin, the illustrations were done by her, she was a great artist. They were perfect for what she wants the children to learn. As the children read this book they will know how to say the kinship terms.  This is one way I am hoping children will learn the kinship terms in our language, also preserving her Cree Language." />
