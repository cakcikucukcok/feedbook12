  <title>Matthew’S Stacking Cups - How San Khoo, Angeline Khoo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story centres on sensitivity to the feelings of others, gratitude, and teamwork. The three smallest cups in a set of stacking cups felt that they were more important than the other cups just because they were stacked right on top. The little boy Matthew gently but firmly pointed out to them that they were perched at the top of the stack only because of the help and support they received from the other cups. All were important in teamwork endeavours, they learnt. One reviewer who is also an author of childrens books (Dr. Cecilia Leong) described it as a delightful story that children can relate to as most children would have played with stacking cups in one way or another. The story is written with charming prose that rhymes and would appeal to young children. The story is simple yet it teaches the importance of valuing every single member of your family or team regardless of his or her position. The watercolour illustrations convey the innocence and purity of a childs inner wisdom. The book is a wonderful story for family time." />
