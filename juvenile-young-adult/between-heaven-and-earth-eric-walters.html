  <title>Between Heaven and Earth - Eric Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DJ is David McLean&#39;s eldest grandson, so it stands to reason that he be the one to scatter his beloved grandfather&#39;s ashes. At least that&#39;s how DJ sees it. He&#39;s always been the best at everything--sports, school, looking after his fatherless family--so climbing Kilimanjaro is just another thing he&#39;ll accomplish almost effortlessly. Or so he thinks, until he arrives in Tanzania and everything starts to go wrong. He&#39;s detained at immigration, he gets robbed, his climbing group includes an old lady and he gets stuck with the first ever female porter. Forced to go &lt;i&gt;polepole&lt;/i&gt; (slowly), DJ finds out the hard way that youth, fitness level and drive have nothing to do with success on the mountain--or in life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;DJ&#39;s adventures start in &lt;i&gt;Jungle Land&lt;/i&gt;, part of The Seven Prequels and continue in &lt;i&gt;Sleeper&lt;/i&gt;, part of The Seven Sequels." />
