  <title>Because I Love You - Max Lucado, Mitchell Heinze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A long time ago a wise man named Shaddai built a wonderful village for children to live in. He talked to them and sang for them and told them stories. He gave them everything they needed. And with his own hands Shaddai built a protective wall around their village, rock by rock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He did all of this for just one reason&amp;mdash;because he loved them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One day Paladin, the village&#39;s most curious child, discovers something troubling about the wall. Something that makes him wonder about Shaddai&#39;s love. Could there be a mistake?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young Paladin is about to discover the answer. And when he does, he will come to understand just how deeply he is loved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so will you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything God does for your children, He does because of love. He protects them. He listens to their prayers. He provides for their needs. He even gives warnings and sets boundaries&amp;mdash;for no other reason than love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an adult you already know this. Now your children can know it too through this captivating tale, which was first published in the award-winning children&#39;s bestseller &lt;em&gt;Tell Me the Story&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let this timeless story of a curious boy&#39;s choice and a caring man&#39;s sacrificial response help you make the infinite love of their Heavenly Father as real to your kids as your own love. Because they need to understand about Him what you have already learned&amp;mdash;that everything God does throughout our lives, He does for one reason only, and for the best reason of all: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Because I Love You.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
