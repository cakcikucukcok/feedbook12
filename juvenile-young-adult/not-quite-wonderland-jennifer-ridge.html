      <meta name="description" content="Alice is bored with her daily life; she&#39;d rather fantasize about magic and romance. Her best friend Clary is more concerned with school and homework. One night, Clary and Alice&#39;s brother disappear and they find themselves in Laurelin-a kingdom in another world. Their arrival coincides with the disappearance of the Princess. As Clary tries to adjust to her stay in the kingdom, she&#39;s recruited to investigate some strange accusations which might be connected to the Princess&#39; disappearance. Princess Elina leads a charmed life. She&#39;s happy to leave the kingdom&#39;s care in the hands of her older sister, the White Queen, who is trying to clean up the mess their mother left behind. She isn&#39;t prepared for one of her guards to turn traitor. He kidnaps her and whisks her away to another world. When they become unintentionally stuck there, Elina has to figure out a way to get home. Thankfully, she finds Alice, who is willing and eager to help. Now if only Elina could understand her kidnapper&#39;s motives." />
