        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Dangerous to be together. Painful to be apart. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Savannah Colbert knows she broke up with Tristan Coleman for the right reasons. Most of all, to keep from killing him with her new vampire abilities. But try telling her heart. Now, lost in a sea of hostile Clann faces, Sav tries to come to terms with what she&#39;s becoming and what that means for her future. And that someone is doing their best to bully her into making a terrible mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tristan can&#39;t belive Sav won&#39;t even talk to him. If being apart is her decision, fine. Just don&#39;t expect him to honor it. But even as he prepares to fight for the girl he loves, forces beyond their control take them both in directions neither could have foreseen, prepared for…or possibly withstand. A reckoning is coming…and not everyone will survive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE CLANN &quot;A spellbinding, compelling, and completely enjoyable debut.&quot; –Electrifying Reviews blog on Crave &quot;Crave is such a refreshing, intoxicating paranormal read.&quot; –&lt;em&gt;Mundie Moms blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
