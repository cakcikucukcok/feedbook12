  <title>Gets to Work! (A Tinyville Town Book) - Brian Biggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The Tinyville Town series, new from &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling author and illustrator Brian Biggs, launches with three books: &lt;I&gt;Tinyville Town Gets to Work!&lt;/I&gt;, a world-establishing picture book that introduces the town and its many residents, and two board books, &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Veterinarian&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Firefighter&lt;/I&gt;. The series is set in a cozy community where the people are kind, everyone says hello when they&amp;rsquo;re walking down the street, the bus is always on time, and all the townsfolk do their part to keep things running smoothly. Everyone has a job to do in Tinyville Town. With a nod to the busy world of Richard Scarry and the neighborhood feel of &lt;I&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/I&gt;, this new series will become a favorite read for preschoolers and is ideal for story time and class discussions about occupations and community helpers. Tinyville Town is a growing, thriving city full of interesting people. The townsfolk can&amp;rsquo;t wait to show readers around!&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; In &lt;I&gt;Tinyville Town Gets to Work!&lt;/I&gt;, we see the evolution of a construction project to solve a problem. When there is a traffic jam on the Tinyville Town bridge, the residents decide to work together to build a new one. By following the hard work of the engineers and construction workers, readers will get to meet many different people in the town while watching the exciting new bridge take shape. The large picture book format and Biggs&amp;rsquo;s bright art brilliantly show the bridge, which was extensively researched to make it authentic for readers.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Every town has a bridge, and a trip over Tinyville&amp;rsquo;s new one will be fun for kids time and time again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
