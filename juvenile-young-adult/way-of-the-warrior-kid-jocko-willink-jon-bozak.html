  <title>Way of the Warrior Kid - Jocko Willink, Jon Bozak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;National Bestseller &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifth grade was the worst year of Marc&#39;s life. He stunk at gym class, math was too hard for him, the school lunch was horrible, and his class field trip was ruined because he couldn&#39;t swim. But what was most awful thing about fifth grade? Kenny Williamson, the class bully, who calls himself the &quot;King of the Jungle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Marc&#39;s mother tells him that his Uncle Jake is coming to stay for the whole summer, Marc can&#39;t wait. Uncle Jake is a for real, super-cool Navy SEAL. And Uncle Jake has a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s going to turn Marc into a warrior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becoming a warrior isn&#39;t easy. It means a lot of pull ups, sit ups, pushups, squats, swimming, eating right, and studying harder than ever before!  Can Marc transform himself into a warrior before school starts in the fall - and finally stand up to the King of the Jungle himself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Way of the Warrior Kid&lt;/i&gt; is a new illustrated chapter book by #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling author and retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink.&lt;/p&gt;" />
