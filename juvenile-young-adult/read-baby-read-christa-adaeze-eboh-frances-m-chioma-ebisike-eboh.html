  <title>Read Baby, Read - Christa Adaeze Eboh, Frances M. Chioma Ebisike-Eboh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Read Baby, Read is a fun simple book that will keep children from zero to six years old interacting with the book every day. It begins with the parent reading to the baby in the womb. Unborn babies will begin to recognize the voice of the parent while developing interest and familiarizing with words as Mom or other family members read. As the baby grows, Read Baby, Read will help the baby acquire knowledge in the areas such as social studies. The book gives opportunity for the mother to paste family and pet pictures. This book also features nature and art, developmental activities, etc., and also addresses all the basic skills that are relevant to newborns through first-grade pupils. This is an all-in-one book that can help a child even if he or she does not have access to other books. In addition, it teaches the child ABCs, 123s, interactions, and storytelling. As the child reads the story Going to the Park toward the end of the book, the child will learn interactions, being safe, and skills in storytelling. This book also gives children the opportunity to write and draw what they want. These will help with their motor skills, as well as expressing themselves. This book covers fine motor skill activities that are relevant for this age group. Read Baby, Read will be an awesome addition to every home library." />
