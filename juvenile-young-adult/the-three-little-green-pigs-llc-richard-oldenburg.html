The descendants of the original Three Little Pigs are now in the construction business, building green homes out of recyclable materials.

Using different recyclable materials, the winning pig must satisfy the city inspector (a descendant of the Big Bad Wolf!). The story ends with the wolf purchasing an ecological home that has several modern changes, and the winning pig hiring his two cousins.
