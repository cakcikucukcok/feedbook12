And, that she did. She has spent the past few months coming to grips with the realization that she is indeed, a witch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Christmas holiday is days away, and her utmost favorite time of the year. Deciding to leave her recluse position at home, she ventured to the Lily Brooke town square to share in the singing, laughing, dancing, and holiday festivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting underneath the twinkling Christmas lights, in the newly-fallen snow, she sees Gabriel approaching. Her heart skipped a beat, as Gabriel is her childhood best friend. She hadn&amp;rsquo;t realized how much she missed him these past few months, while holed up in her bedroom for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending a much-needed evening with Gabriel, Magdalena agrees to go camping with the rest their friend group, the next evening. MALB, the Mystical Alliance of Lily Brooke, is their childhood secret club, made up of six, thirteen-year-old friends. They had grown up thinking they were the secret crime solvers of Lily Brooke. Needless to say, they hadn&amp;rsquo;t expected the real mystery that had fallen in their laps this past autumn. But, time heels, so Magdalena was excited to rally the gang back together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next evening, MALB roasted smores, told ghost stories by the light of the moon, and tucked themselves into their sleeping bags tightly, by the amber glow of the campfire. In the middle of the night, Magdalena awoke to the screeching sound of something awful. Realizing it was werewolves, and not wanting to bring any danger to her friends, she snuck off into the woods to deal with the problem alone. Not expecting the turn of events, Magdalena found herself free-falling over the banks of a snowy slippery slope with a three-headed werewolf attached to her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriel awakens and realizes his best friend is missing. The rest of MALB follows Magdalena&amp;rsquo;s foot-steps right up to the bank of the cliff. From here, the gang experiences the ride of a life time down the slope, through a hidden vortex, into The Enchanted Forest, and through the drawbridge gate of Lindtzl Castle. The thrill and terror that awaits them as they try to find their best friend will keep you on the edge of your seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magdalena Gottschalk: The Slippery Slope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is an epic fantasy fiction thriller written for middle grade ages up through adulthood.
