  <title>The Big, Blue, Overstuffed Chair - Carolyn Spicer, Arvon Swanberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elvira is a kind-hearted Rhode Island Red hen who lives in a cozy house at the end of a quiet street. One morning, after Elvira Hen decides to take a walk along a path that leads into the big woods, she makes a shocking discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Elvira finds a paper sack filled with money, she immediately takes it to the police station, where a policeman promises to find its rightful owner. But when no one comes forward to claim the money, Elvira suddenly finds herself richer than she ever imagined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On her way home, Elvira sees a beautiful, big, blue, overstuffed chair in a store window. Even though she now has the money to purchase the chair, Elvira decides to wait for another day. Finally, after all the tax collectors pay her a visit, Elvira has just enough left over to purchase the chair. But soon Elvira learns that nothing is certain in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this childrens tale, a hen who is determined to do the right thing must rely on friendship, love, and the goodness of her heart after she makes a discovery that leads her down an unexpected path in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
