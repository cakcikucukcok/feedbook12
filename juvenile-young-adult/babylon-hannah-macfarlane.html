  <title>Babylon - Hannah MacFarlane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They changed my name, but not my heart. I became Belteshazzar: &#39;Prince of Bel&#39;. I accepted the label, but not Bel, or Marduk, or any of the others. Inside I was always Daniel: &#39;God is my judge&#39;. I never forgot the name of my childhood, though I rarely heard it again. My God had written its truth into my soul and nobody could take it away. Not even Nebuchadrezzar. Daniel is far from home. Jerusalem has been decimated and he has been taken back to Babylon, the most powerful city in the world. As he enters the gates, he feels sick with revulsion. This will be his home for the next seventy years, perhaps even more, but will he be able to stay true to Yahweh, even despite the horrific dangers that will bring? He underestimated Yahweh. They all did. 
Part of the Dark Chapters series which tell the darker stories from the Bible, Babylon tells the story of Daniel, from his exile to Babylon through to the lions’ den and beyond. Babylon focuses on the story of one character from the Bible and sees how their life compares to how God wants us to live. The text does not sensationalise the horrific aspects of Daniel&#39;s story for entertainment&#39;s sake, nor does it trivialise what it has to say to us today." />
