  <title>CATHERINE AND FREDERICK - A German Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 376&lt;br /&gt;
In this 376th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the German Fairy Tale of &amp;quot;CATHERINE AND FREDERIK&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a story about a youth named Frederick and a girl called Catherine, who had married and lived together as a young couple. One day Fred said, &amp;quot;I am now going into the fields, dear Catherine, and by the time I return let there be something hot upon the table, for I shall be hungry, and something to drink, too, for I shall be thirsty.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Very well, dear Fred,&amp;quot; said she, &amp;quot;go at once, and I will make all right for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
As soon, then, as dinner-time approached, she took down a sausage out of the chimney, and putting it in a frying-pan with batter, set it over the fire. Soon the sausage began to frizzle and spit while Catherine stood by holding the handle of the pan and thinking; and thought that while the sausage was getting ready she might go into the cellar and draw some beer. So she took a can and went down into the cellar to draw the beer, and while it ran into the can, she bethought herself that perhaps the dog might steal the sausage out of the pan, and so up the cellar stairs she ran, but too late, for the rogue had already got the meat in his mouth and was sneaking off&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;and that was just the beginning of a story full of mishap and silly occurrences &amp;ndash; more a comedy of errors.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
