  <title>THE DONKEY CABBAGE - A tale about a Donkey - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 367&lt;br /&gt;
In this 367th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE DONKEY CABBAGE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, there was a young Hunter who went boldly into the forest. He had a merry and light heart, and as he went whistling along there came an ugly old woman, who said to him, &amp;#39;Good-day, dear hunter! You are very merry and contented, but I suffer hunger and thirst, so give me a trifle.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hunter felt sorry for the poor old woman, and he felt in his pocket and gave her all he could spare. He was about to go on, but the old woman stopped him and said, &amp;#39;Listen, dear hunter, to what I say. Because of your kind heart I will make you a present. Go on your way, and in a short time you will come to a tree on which sit nine birds who have a cloak in their claws and are quarrelling over it. Then take aim with your gun and shoot in the middle of them; they will let the cloak fall, but one of the birds will be hit and will drop down dead. Take the cloak with you; it is a wishing-cloak, and when you throw it on your shoulders you have only to wish yourself at a certain place, and in the twinkling of an eye you are there. Take the heart out of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and early every morning when you get up you will find a gold piece under your pillow.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What a story this is turning out to be&amp;hellip;..? What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did the hunter follow the old woman&amp;rsquo;s instructions and did what she come true? What else happened? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
