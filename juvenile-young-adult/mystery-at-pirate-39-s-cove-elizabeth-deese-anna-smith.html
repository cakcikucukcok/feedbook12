  <title>Mystery at Pirate&#39;s Cove - Elizabeth Deese, Anna Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; Two young children are spending their first full summer vacation with their
widowed grandmother and her brother, Uncle Joe, in the small town of Bath, North Carolina.
They are not looking forward to staying in the small town. They think they have a
long boring summer ahead. But they learn that their grandmother&#39;s restaurant,
Pirate&#39;s Cove, is being constantly robbed of its supplies. They team up with two
other children from the neighborhood and solve the baffling mystery that even the
police can&#39;t seem to solve. Could some of the things Uncle Joe tells them about
the pirate Blackbeard set them on the right track in solving the &lt;B&gt;Mystery at
Pirate&#39;s Cove&lt;/B&gt;? &lt;/P&gt;
