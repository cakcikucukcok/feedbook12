  <title>Watch Hollow - Gregory Funaro, Matthew Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Gregory Funaro brings us into a world where magic exists, monsters roam in the shadows, and wooden animals come to life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep within the enchanted woods in the town of Watch Hollow stands the once-grand Blackford House, whose halls hold a magical secret: a giant cuckoo clock that does much more than tell time. But when the clock&amp;#8217;s gears cease to turn, an evil presence lurking among the trees begins to come out of the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lucy and Oliver Tinker arrive in Watch Hollow, they have no idea that anything is wrong. A mysterious stranger has made their father an offer that&amp;#8217;s too good for him to refuse. All Mr. Tinker needs to do is fix the clock at Blackford House and fistfuls of gold coins are his to keep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t take long, however, for the children to realize that there is more to Blackford House than meets the eye. And before they can entirely understand the strange world they&amp;#8217;ve stumbled into, Lucy and Oliver must join forces with a host of magical clock animals to defeat the Garr&amp;#8212;a vicious monster that not only wants Blackford House for itself, but also seeks to destroy everything the Tinkers hold dear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
