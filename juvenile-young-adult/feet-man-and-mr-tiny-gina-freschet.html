  <title>Feet Man and Mr. Tiny - Gina Freschet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Feet Man has two gigantic problems - his feet. His foot size is triple-extra-umpteen-large. He has never found a shoe that fits him, and whenever people see him, they always point and make fun of him. But then one day he discovers a tiny man stuck between his toes - Mr. Tiny, to be exact. Mr. Tiny has his share of problems, too, but he doesn&#39;t let them bother him. He knows that everyone, no matter how unusual, has a talent. And when Mr. Tiny spots an advertisement for the Husky Puppy Shoe Company in the newspaper - &quot;If We Can&#39;t Fit Your Size, We&#39;ll Give You a Giant Prize!&quot; - he knows that Feet Man is a &lt;i&gt;shoe&lt;/i&gt;-in to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With lively illustrations and pun-ny read-aloud text, this friendship between two characters of vastly different shoe size demonstrates that sometimes it takes an outsider to help us discover what we are best at.&lt;/p&gt;" />
