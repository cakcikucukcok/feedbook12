  <title>Goodbye, Charley - Jane Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forming bonds in a time of war&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the summer of 1943, and for twelve-year-old Celie Marsh the war seems awfully close to her coastal Massachusetts home. She worries about bombs and submarines, and about her big brother, who can&#39;t wait to go off and fight. Her little brother doesn&#39;t seem to need her anymore, and her best friend has moved away. When her father brings Charley, a monkey, home from work one day, Celie finds the comforting companion she has been missing. But more upheaval is in store: irritating Joey Bentley moves in with his crabby grandmother next door, her mother takes a job building warships, and worst of all, Charley proves to be too wild for Celie to manage. A near disaster forces Celie to make a heart-wrenching decision that teaches her painful lessons about friendship, family, and the meaning of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tender novel about relationships, based on the author&#39;s mother&#39;s experience, is elegantly crafted and suffused with warmth, as well as with a powerful sense of time and place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
