  <title>Crazy Daisy the Environmental Cow  and the Fracking War - Lynne Pickering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daisy the milking cow is a happy, friendly, placid cow who loves to listen to the birds sing.  One day, the silence is broken when trucks arrive next door and workers chop down the trees. They bring noisy machinery and build tall towers. There is a terrible loud sound that is never ending. The animals nerves become jangled. The bees and the birds leave. Jasmine the duck loses her feathers and becomes sick from her polluted pond. Daisy is so nervous her milk has bubbles. People arrive with banners to protest about the fracking. Daisy rallies all the animals to join in the protest and help the people. War is declared; their farms are threatened. Many farm animals, pigs, geese, goats, chickens, and naughty hawks join the protesters. The animals become a nuisance, climbing over the machinery and eating the workers lunches. The hawks bomb the workers with eggs. Together, people and animals successfully drive the frackers to a desert. This is a hilarious story of cooperation, determination, and caring for the community and the environment. Animals and people become the best of friends, and Daisy becomes a local hero." />
