  <title>Upsy Downsy Bella Ballerina - Belinda Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bella Ballerina is a &quot;brown eyed beauty&quot; and she is the center of attention in her family. Curious and very demanding like most toddlers, Bella Ballerina is a &quot;fashionista,&quot; by her own right. Her favorite wardrobe selection would be her ballet outfit (especially the &quot;tutu&quot;) on any given day. Her Mommy allows her to wear it several days a week. That is after she purchased a backup outfit, in case of an emergency (spill or tear)!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bella feels at home in almost all settings, she is a toddler magnet, making new friends easily. However, the only thing she wants more than her pink tutu is &quot;Down Hair.&quot; Bella wants her &quot;kinky curly puff-balls&quot; to somehow look like Mommy and her big Sissy&#39;s. Down hair as she calls it. Getting Mommy to realize what &quot;down hair&quot; for Bella Ballerina is her only real frustration. So read, smile, laugh and just imagine how at three years old you would have described your ideal hair do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
