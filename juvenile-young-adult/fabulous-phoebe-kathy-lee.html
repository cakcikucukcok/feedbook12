  <title>Fabulous Phoebe - Kathy Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Me and my friend Ellie have a system for grading boys – like GCSEs. 
A - Absolutely Adorable.
B - Better than most.
C - Could be okay, if...
D - Don&#39;t bother.
E - Excruciating.
F - Friend of Frankenstein.
The problem is A-grade boys expect to go out with A-grade girls. (You know - gorgeous face, good figure, skin without a single spot. Brain cells an optional extra.) I&#39;m not, if I&#39;m honest, any higher than a C. Could be okay. Could be okay if...? If I was thinner. 
On top of that I&#39;m trying to work out what the creepy Bird Woman is up to and talk to God about it all. And then there&#39;s the Awful Babysitting Incident. I don&#39;t even want to think about that...
Phoebe is 13, a Christian, and she is overweight. She has a great sense of humour and her escapades are full of jokes and fun. As Phoebe tells her story, she tries to figure out who is poisoning the cats, what&#39;s that creepy bird woman up to, why is the perfect girl at church so mean at school, is it OK to be embarrassed about being a Christian, and most important of all, &quot;how on earth can I get boys to like me?&quot; Phoebe discovers it&#39;s no good pretending to God, he sees both the beauty and the bad inside you. Body image is a massive issue in our culture causing problems for thousands of young girls. The Phoebe series does not offer solutions, but portrays an overweight Christian girl in a positive light telling of her struggles and discoveries in life." />
