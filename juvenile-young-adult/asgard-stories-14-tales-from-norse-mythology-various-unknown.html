  <title>ASGARD STORIES - 14 Tales from Norse Mythology - Various Unknown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A GREAT READ FOR KIDS! In this volume you will find 14 of the most popular Norse Myths and Tales rewritten especially for children and Young Adults, retold by Mary Foster and Mabel Cummings - tales and stories like Odin&amp;rsquo;s Reward, Tyr and the Wolf, Freyja&amp;rsquo;s Necklace, The Hammer of Thor, A Gift from Frigga, The Stealing of Iduna, Skadi, &amp;AElig;gir&amp;rsquo;s Feast and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book will also help you better understand the mythology behind the characters in Marvel&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster movie THOR, with stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
THE HAMMER OF THOR&lt;br /&gt;
THOR&amp;rsquo;S WONDERFUL JOURNEY&lt;br /&gt;
HOW THOR LOST HIS HAMMER&lt;br /&gt;
THE PUNISHMENT OF LOKI to name but a few.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This volume is the outcome of several years&amp;rsquo; experience of the telling of the classic Norse myths to classes of children. It was found that these were the most popular and quite often re-requested of the stories. There are graphic descriptions in these Norse tales of the hard struggle with rugged nature and the severe climate of Northern Europe. The tales and adventures are of equally rugged men and women full of bravery, heroes in a time when heroes were needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But this is simply not a number of made up tales, many works were consulted in the preparation of this volume, and the compilers are especially indebted to the following: Thorpe&amp;rsquo;s translation of S&amp;aelig;mund&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Edda&amp;rdquo;; &amp;ldquo;The Younger Edda,&amp;rdquo; in translations; Anderson&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Norse Mythology&amp;rdquo;; Guerber&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Myths of Northern Lands&amp;rdquo;; William and Mary Howitt&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Literature and Romance of Northern Europe&amp;rdquo;; and Mallet&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Northern Antiquities&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Now there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of extracurricular reading for you&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;" />
