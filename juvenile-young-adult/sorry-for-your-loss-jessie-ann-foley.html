  <title>Sorry for Your Loss - Jessie Ann Foley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Printz Honor winner and Morris Award finalist Jessie Ann Foley comes a comitragic YA novel that will appeal to fans of Jandy Nelson and Jeff Zentner.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the youngest of eight, painfully average Pup Flanagan is used to flying under the radar. He&amp;#8217;s barely passing his classes. He lets his longtime crush walk all over him. And he&amp;#8217;s in no hurry to decide on a college path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only person who ever made him think he could be more was his older brother Patrick. But that was before Patrick died suddenly, leaving Pup with a family who won&amp;#8217;t talk about it and acquaintances who just keep saying, &amp;#8220;sorry for your loss.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pup excels at a photography assignment he thought he&amp;#8217;d bomb, things start to come into focus. His dream girl shows her true colors. An unexpected friend exposes Pup to a whole new world, right under his nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the photograph that was supposed to show Pup a way out of his grief ultimately reveals someone else who is still stuck in their own. Someone with a secret regret Pup never could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
