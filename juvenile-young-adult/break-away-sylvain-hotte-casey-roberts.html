  <title>Break Away - Sylvain Hotte, Casey Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alexandre McKenzie lives in a town on the North Shore of the St. Lawrence River. Summer finds him riding through the bush on his quad or fishing in an inland lake. In winter he is a promising midget hockey star who often takes refuge at his camp in the woods. But one fall, his stature and talent take a turn for the worse as he plunges into a relationship with a girl whose future appears plagued by tragedy.  Alex has to fight his own demons. Like the moose that haunts him from the moment he meets Jessica—and that sheds its antlers with the first snow only to grow bigger ones the next season—Alex has to learn to hold his head high and become a frontrunner once again. Break Away deals with friendship, family, and love and could take place anywhere in Canada where there is winter, hockey, and young people. " />
