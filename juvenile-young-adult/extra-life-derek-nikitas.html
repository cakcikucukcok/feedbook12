  <title>Extra Life - Derek Nikitas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Russ has never been your typical teen. After being expelled, Russ has started to get his life back on track. He&amp;#8217;s a pop culture junkie, and living in a town where the popular teen soap &amp;#147;Cape Twilight&amp;#8221; is filmed, how could he not be? So when Russ decides to make his own short film, he recruits the (emotionally unhinged) star of &amp;#147;Cape Twilight&amp;#8221; and his own motley crew to help out. Seems like a great idea...until the plan blows up in Russ&amp;#8217;s face.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just when everything seems to be falling apart, Russ receives a message on his cell phone &amp;#151; from himself. Recorded in the future, &amp;#145;future Russ&amp;#8217; informes him that the day can be fixed if he&amp;#8217;s willing to use an app to leap twelve hours into the past. Russ is happy to oblige, figuring the day can&amp;#8217;t get any worse. But he couldn&amp;#8217;t be more wrong. Because as soon as Russ tampers with time and space, he introduces dangerous glitches he can&amp;#8217;t control, including alternate of himself. And suddenly Russ&amp;#8217;s sanity and the lives of everyone he cares about are at risk if he can&amp;#8217;t find a way to regain control of his own life&amp;#151; past, present and future.&lt;/div&gt;" />
