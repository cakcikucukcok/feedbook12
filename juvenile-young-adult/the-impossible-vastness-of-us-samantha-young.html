          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I know how to watch my back. I&#39;m the only one that ever has.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;India Maxwell hasn&#39;t just moved across the country—she&#39;s plummeted to the bottom rung of the social ladder. It&#39;s taken years to cover the mess of her home life with a veneer of popularity. Now she&#39;s living in one of Boston&#39;s wealthiest neighbourhoods with her mom&#39;s fiancé and his daughter, Eloise. Thanks to her soon-to-be stepsister&#39;s clique of friends, including Eloise&#39;s gorgeous, arrogant boyfriend, Finn, India feels like the one thing she hoped never to be seen as again: trash.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But India&#39;s not alone in struggling to control the secrets of her past. Eloise and Finn, the school&#39;s golden couple, aren&#39;t all they seem to be. In fact, everyone&#39;s life is infinitely more complex than it first appears. And as India grows closer to Finn and befriends Eloise, threatening the facades that hold them together, what&#39;s left are truths that are brutal, beautiful and big enough to change them forever…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Samantha Young comes a story of friendship, identity and acceptance that will break your heart—and make it whole again.&lt;/p&gt;
