  <title>Harlem Hustle - Janet McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hustle&#39;s personal &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Harlem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; was sorely in need of a renaissance. For him, it was the place where a scared kid named Eric Samson had been ditched by druggy parents and dismissed by frustrated teachers. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abandoned to the streets to raise himself, Eric Samson knows life won&#39;t be easy, beginning with the choices he must make. The fast cash of the streets still tempts him, but the threat of getting locked up - again - is daunting. Maybe Eric&#39;s way out is as Harlem Hustle, the rapper he dreams of being. At his side is Manley &quot;Ride&quot; Freeman, surrogate brother and best friend. And Jeannette Simpson, the college-bound &quot;round-the-way&quot; girl he hopes will be more than a friend. But does Eric have the strength to leave the familiar street life behind and the courage to reach for his dream?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her companion to &lt;i&gt;Brother Hood&lt;/i&gt;, Janet McDonald once again captures the rhythms of Harlem in this fast, funny story of a restless teenager who uses the power of words to rise above it all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
