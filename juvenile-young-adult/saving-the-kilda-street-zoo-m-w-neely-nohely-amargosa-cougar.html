  <title>Saving the Kilda Street Zoo - M. W. Neely, Nohely, Amargosa Cougar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vagas is a native of Pondera. She was born there and has spent her entire life in the little town. It is a sleepy gathering of several thousand people near the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in central California. The residents are very different than in most California towns. They rarely hurry anywhere. They seem to have all the time in the world. Most of the businesses depend on tourists and travelers passing through. There are always new faces, which will probably not be seen again in the stores and restaurants. Oddly dressed outsiders wander up and down the main street stretching their legs after driving all day. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;bR&gt;
The two motels at the north and south ends of town always fill up as the sun begins to set each evening. Weekends and especially holidays are very busy times in Pondera. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Pondera town zoo has always been part of Vagas life too, at least as far back as she can remember. She and Midori have spent many wonderful days there watching the various animals. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;Br&gt;
It isnt a big zoolike in a city. The entrance is on Kilda Street. There is a tall brown adobe type of wall across the front with evenly spaced windows on both sides of the opening where the ticket booth stands. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Theres a sign on the front of the booth with the hours of operation and $2.00 general admission in big letters on it. Children under the age of twelve get in for $1.00. Kids under the age of six get in free.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The ticket booth is one of those that has a thick pane of glass with a round hole in it to talk through and a square cut-out near the bottom for collecting payment and dispensing tickets. In that booth is usually an elderly lady named Mary who has worked there selling tickets for as long as Vagas can
remember." />
