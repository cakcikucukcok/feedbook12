  <title>TWO CHILDREN’s STORIES FROM 1001ARABIAN NIGHTS - How the Camel Got his Hump and The Crab that Played with the Sea - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 228&lt;br /&gt;
In this 228th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Arabian Nights stories of &lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;How the Camel Got his Hump&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Crab that Played with the Sea&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first tale Baba tells how the Camel got his big hump. In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the Animals were just beginning to work for Man. There was a Camel, and he lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work; and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, and was most &amp;#39;scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said &amp;#39;Humph!&amp;#39; Just &amp;#39;Humph!&amp;#39; and said no more. Presently the Horse came to him with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, &amp;#39;Camel, O Camel, come out and trot like the rest of us.&amp;#39; But all Camel said was &amp;#39;Humph!, &amp;#39;Humph!&amp;#39; and walked away. A bit later the dog tried to entice camel out, as did Ox. All received the same rude answer. Then Man called Horse, Dog and Ox together and at the same time &amp;#39;Djinn of All Deserts&amp;rsquo; came along and they posed their problem to him. &amp;lsquo;leave it to me said Djinn of All Deserts and off he went to find Camel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
