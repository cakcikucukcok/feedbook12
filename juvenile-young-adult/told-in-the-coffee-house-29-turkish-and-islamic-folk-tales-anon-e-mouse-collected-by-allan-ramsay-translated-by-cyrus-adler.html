  <title>TOLD IN THE COFFEE HOUSE - 29 Turkish and Islamic Folk Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Collected by Allan Ramsay, Translated by Cyrus Adler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the course of a number of visits to Istanbul, Cyrus Adler* became interested in the tales that were being told in the coffee houses of the city, and many they were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are 29 of the most notable Turkish and Islamic stories recorded and translated by Adler in partnership with Allan Ramsay. Herein you will find stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
How the Hodja saved Allah&lt;br /&gt;
The Hanoum and the Unjust Cadi&lt;br /&gt;
How Cobbler Ahmet became the Chief Astrologer&lt;br /&gt;
The Wise Son of Ali Pasha&lt;br /&gt;
The Merciful Khan&lt;br /&gt;
King Kara-Kush of Bithynia&lt;br /&gt;
We know not what the Dawn may Bring Forth&lt;br /&gt;
The Effects of Raki&lt;br /&gt;
and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It must be noted that while Turkish folklore is entertaining and is guaranteed to give rise to a smile, a chuckle or even laughter, the stories do have a gravity of their own and will impart a wisdom only found in Eastern lands.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Turkish Coffee Houses have an intimacy which encourages the sharing of stories. They usually consist of a little more than rooms, with walls made of small panes of glass. The furniture consists of a tripod with a contrivance for holding the kettle, and a fire to keep the coffee boiling. A carpeted bench traverses the entire length of the room. This is occupied by turbaned Turks, their legs folded under them, smoking hookahs or chibouks, and sipping coffee. A few will be engaged in a game of backgammon, but the majority enter into conversation, at first only in syllables, which gradually gives rise to a general discussion. Finally, some sage of the neighborhood comes in, and the company appeals to him to settle the point at issue. This he usually does by telling a story to illustrate his opinion. Some of the stories told on these occasions are adaptations of those already known in Arabic and Persian literature, but the Turkish mind gives them a new setting and a peculiar philosophy. They are characteristic of the habits, customs, and methods of thought of the people, and for this reason seem worthy of preservation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the stories have been collected by Mr. Allan Ramsay, who, by a long residence in Constantinople, has had special, and many, opportunities for learning to know the modern Turk.&lt;br /&gt;
Cyrus Adler (1863 &amp;ndash; 1940) was an American educator, Jewish religious leader and scholar.&lt;br /&gt;
