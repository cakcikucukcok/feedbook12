  <title>Dragons for Kris - Galand A. Nuchols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fearing to make a sound that would attract attention and perhaps prevent his escape, Kris sits in the dark on the edge of his perfectly made bed. It is 4:25 AM. His most precious possessions have been secretly stored down the street with friends. Grandpa finally arrived yesterday, driving King Arthur, an eighteen-wheeler truck.&lt;/p&gt;
What will he tell Grandpa? Will Grandpa believe Kris&#39;s own uncle means him harm? Will Kris&#39;s secret plan to leave his uncle&#39;s home and live with his grandparents, work? These agonizing questions swirl in Kris&#39;s head until he hears a soft sound in the hall and then watches the doorknob slowly, silently turn. Who is coming into his room? Is it his grandpa or his uncle? &lt;I&gt;Is it too late?&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
