  <title>Gabby&#39;s Stick-to-It Day - Sheila Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our favorite little angel is back with more giggles, more fun, and an important message for little girls&lt;/b&gt;—&lt;b&gt;don’t give up when things get hard.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gabby is a little guardian angel with a big job to do! Watching over Sophie is hard work, but Gabby knows that God wants her to stick to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gabby, God’s Little Angel, flies to the rescue as Sophie attempts to help others but has a little trouble sticking with things. Sophie tries to be helpful by washing the family dog for her mom, but she gives up when she’s the one who ends up all wet. She then tries to be kind by reading to her little brother, but he has plans of his own, which include a splash of cereal right in Sophie’s face! When Sophie is ready to quit once again, it’s up to Gabby to encourage her to keep trying and to teach her what the Bible says about perseverance: “We must not become tired of doing good. We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time if we do not give up.” (Galatians 6:9 NCV)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meets national education standards.&lt;/p&gt;" />
