  <title>Here So Far Away - Hadley Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Award-winning author Hadley Dyer&amp;#8217;s YA debut is smart, snarky, and emotionally gripping, about a rebellious cop&amp;#8217;s daughter who falls in love with an older man, loses her best friend, and battles depression, all while trying to survive her last year of high school.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Feisty and fearless George Warren (given name: Frances, but no one calls her that) has never let life get too serious. Now that she&amp;#8217;s about to be a senior, her plans include partying with her tight-knit group of friends and then getting the heck out of town after graduation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But instead of owning her last year of high school, a fight with her best friend puts her on the outs of their social circle. &amp;#160;If that weren&amp;#8217;t bad enough, George&amp;#8217;s family has been facing hard times since her father, a police sergeant, got injured and might not be able to return to work, which puts George&amp;#8217;s college plans in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when George meets Francis, an older guy who shares her name and her affinity for sarcastic banter, she&amp;#8217;s thrown. If she lets herself, she&amp;#8217;ll fall recklessly, hopelessly in love. But because of Francis&amp;#8217;s age, she tells no one&amp;#8212;and ends up losing almost everything, including herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a gorgeous, atmospheric, and gut-wrenching novel that readers won&amp;#8217;t soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
