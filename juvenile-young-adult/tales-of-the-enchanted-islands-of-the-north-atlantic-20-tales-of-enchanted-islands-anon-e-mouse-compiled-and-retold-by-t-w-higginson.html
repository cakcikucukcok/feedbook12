  <title>TALES OF THE ENCHANTED ISLANDS OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC - 20 Tales of Enchanted Islands - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Retold by T W Higginson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These tales have been gathered for more than a thousand years about the islands of the North Atlantic. In all ages and with all sea-going races there has always been something especially fascinating about an island amid the ocean. Its very existence has for all explorers an air of magic. To seafarers an island offers safety after the danger of the open sea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 20 tales about these enchanted islands of the North Atlantic are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Story of Atlantis&lt;br /&gt;
Taliessin of the Radiant Brow&lt;br /&gt;
The Swan-Children of Lir&lt;br /&gt;
Usheen in the Island of Youth&lt;br /&gt;
Bran the Blessed&lt;br /&gt;
The Castle of the Active Door&lt;br /&gt;
Merlin the Enchanter&lt;br /&gt;
Sir Lancelot of the Lake&lt;br /&gt;
The Half-Man&lt;br /&gt;
King Arthur at Avalon&lt;br /&gt;
Maelduin&amp;#39;s Voyage&lt;br /&gt;
The Voyage of St. Brandan&lt;br /&gt;
Kirwan&amp;#39;s Search for Hy-Brasail&lt;br /&gt;
The Isle of Satan&amp;#39;s Hand&lt;br /&gt;
Antillia, the Island of the Seven Cities&lt;br /&gt;
Harald the Viking&lt;br /&gt;
The Search for Norumbega&lt;br /&gt;
The Guardians of the St. Lawrence&lt;br /&gt;
The Island of Demons&lt;br /&gt;
Bimini and the Fountain of Youth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you set foot on such an island and you can begin to understand the legends of enchantment which the ages have collected around such spots. Climb to the heights of Glastonbury Tor and gaze westwards, and you look out over the Bristol Channel, you can imagine yourself to be at the masthead of some lonely vessel, kept forever at sea. You feel as if no one but yourself has ever landed there; and yet, perhaps, even there, looking straight downward, you can imagine you see below you in some crevice of the rock, a mast or spar of some wrecked vessel, encrusted with all manner of shells and barnacles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to curl up with these ancient legends not seen in print for many-a-year; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;
