  <title>Muggle&#39;s Guide To Harry Potter - Wikipedia contributors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the Muggles&amp;#39; Guide to Harry Potter, a collaborative effort towards providing an extensive guidebook to the Harry Potter series. Readers should be able to learn more about the characters, places, events, and magic than what is merely present in the books. Critical commentary on each chapter, character, place, and event is provided in an effort to help the reader better understand detailed content and realize possible underlying connections to a greater storyline. It is also intended that the book will shed some light on the story-telling techniques used, and offer some analysis, if possible, into why the series proved so popular. This book is meant to cover only the actual series, the seven books that make up the actual story.&lt;br /&gt;
Major sections:&lt;br /&gt;
Books - Chapter by chapter guides to the individual books.&lt;br /&gt;
Places - Where the characters go and what is discovered there.&lt;br /&gt;
Major Events - Analysis of important events that stand out.&lt;br /&gt;
Magic - Details and implications related to the use of various magical devices, creatures, spells, and even miscellaneous terms used in the books.&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline - Chronological overview of actions and events occurring before, during, and after Harry&amp;#39;s years at Hogwarts." />
