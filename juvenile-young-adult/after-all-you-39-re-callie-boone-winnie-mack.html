      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, fishsticks, tartar, and a side of fries!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runaway ferrets, former BFF drama-trauma, and one GIGANTIC (and very, very public) belly flop. No doubt about it, Callie Boone&#39;s summer is CRUMMY. The only things keeping her afloat are dive practice with her dad and a top-secret Olympic dream. Then a boy named Hoot--who is NOT her boyfriend!--moves in next door and turns her world upside down and right-side up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when things start looking up, real disaster strikes and Callie feels like she&#39;s stuck at the top of the high diving board with no way down. What if she can&#39;t fix all the things that need fixing? She&#39;ll just have to try! With a little luck, a solid plan, and a whole lot of teamwork, she just might make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, she&#39;s Callie Boone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After All, You&#39;re Callie Boone&lt;/i&gt; is a 2011 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
