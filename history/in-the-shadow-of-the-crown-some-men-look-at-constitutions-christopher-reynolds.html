  <title>In the Shadow of the Crown: Some Men Look At Constitutions... - Christopher Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christopher Reynolds began an extensive study of Australian political history and the Australian Constitution when he was a senior professional staff member in the U.S. Congress in the 1980s.   As someone who drafted and promoted legislation, he was interested in Australia&#39;s complicated relationship with Britain as well as what it needs to change to promote democracy.   Quoting authors from Aristotle to Thomas Jefferson, and a host of Australian authorities, Reynolds outlines Australia&#39;s journey from being a dominion of the British Empire toward independence. He supports his findings by examining documents from British archives, Australian constitutional debates, as well as the constitutions of other nations that lead to the path of meaningful reform.   Take a revealing journey through the history of Australian politics and consider a model of government based on involvement and interaction rather than conflict with In the Shadow of the Crown." />
