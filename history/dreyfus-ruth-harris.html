  <title>Dreyfus - Ruth Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The definitive history of the infamous scandal that shook a nation and stunned the world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1894, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer in the French army, was wrongfully convicted of being a spy for Germany and imprisoned on Devil&#39;s Island. Over the following years, attempts to correct this injustice tore France apart, inflicting wounds on the society which have never fully healed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how did a fairly obscure miscarriage of justice come to break up families in bitterness, set off anti-Semitic riots across the French empire, and nearly trigger a coup d&#39;état? How did a violently reactionary, obscurantist attitude become so powerful in a country that saw itself as the home of enlightenment? Why did the battle over a junior army officer occupy the foremost writers and philosophers of the age, from Émile Zola to Marcel Proust, Émile Durkheim, and many others? What drove the anti-Dreyfusards to persist in their efforts even after it became clear that much of the prosecution&#39;s evidence was faked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing upon thousands of previously unread and unconsidered sources, prizewinning historian Ruth Harris goes beyond the conventional narrative of truth loving democrats uniting against proto-fascists. Instead, she offers the first in-depth history of both sides in the Affair, showing how complex interlocking influences--tensions within the military, the clashing demands of justice and nationalism, and a tangled web of friendships and family connections--shaped both the coalition working to free Dreyfus and the formidable alliances seeking to protect the reputation of the army that had convicted him. Sweeping and engaging, &lt;i&gt;Dreyfus&lt;/i&gt; offers a new understanding of one of the most contested and significant moments in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
