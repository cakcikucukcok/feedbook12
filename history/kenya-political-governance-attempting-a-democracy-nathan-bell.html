  <title>Kenya Political Governance, Attempting a Democracy - Nathan Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kenya Political Governance, attempting a Democracy. Kenya History Polital Book. The Kenyan state loses four billion US dollars to corruption every year - anywhere from 25 to 30 percent of the total state budget. This situation is clearly affecting both the foreign and domestic investment climate, as highlighted recently by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International. There is also a growing discrepancy between the steady rate of economic growth and the sinking average incomes in the country. Here, too, the inequality of access to public services, driven by corruption, is one of the main root causes of the problem. Marginalized segments of the population in particular are excluded from services, which exacerbates the potential for conflict. There is a growing risk that Kenya&#39;s current decentralization process, and the associated partial transfer of power and resources to local administrative authorities, will also lead to the decentralization of corruption." />
