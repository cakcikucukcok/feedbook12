  <title>Irish Eccentrics - Peter Somerville-Large</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Ireland&#39;s history has long been illuminated, and enlivened, by bizarre, colourful, extravagant, unfettered individuals: ripe country-house eccentrics, saints, scholars, bucks and hell-rakes, duellists, abductors, rhymers and miracle-makers. These factual and fascinating biographical sketches make for &#39;delightful reading&#39; (Frank Muir). First published in 1975 this new edition includes fresh material and is now in its second printing. Reviews of the 1975 edition: &#39;Mr Somerville-Large writes with &amp;#233;lan and erudition&#39; - Tim Heald, The Times. &#39;A delightful compendium of sheer nuttiness. If, as sociologists suggest, eccentricity is a luxury, Ireland is portrayed in this book as one of the most luxurious countries anywhere.&#39; - Malcolm MacPherson, Newsweek. &#39;Mr Somerville-Large has probed the annals of dim Anglo-Irish families to produce a rare gallery of human curiosities. All human life is here with a vengeance, and in these affectionately presented pages its vagaries know no bounds. &#39; - William Trevor, The Guardian. &#39;Peter Somerville-Large has parcelled up as colourful a batch of nature&#39;s sports as could be found a whisker this side of lunacy, and has written about them in a witty detached prose style which admirably sets off their extraordinary behaviour S delightful reading.&#39; - Frank Muir, The Spectator&lt;/div&gt;" />
