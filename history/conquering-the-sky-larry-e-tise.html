  <title>Conquering the Sky - Larry E. Tise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The nail-biting account of the Wright brothers&#39; secret flights at Kitty Hawk and their unexpected rise to fame&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their great achievements following their first powered flights in 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright still enjoyed virtual anonymity until 1908. In seven crucial days in May of that year, however, the eyes of the world were suddenly cast upon them as they sought lucrative government contracts for their flying technology and then had to prove the capabilities of their machines. In these pivotal moments, the brothers were catapulted into unwanted worldwide fame as the international press discovered and followed their covert flight tests, and reported their every move using rudimentary telegraphs and early forms of photography. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the brothers&#39; rise to fame on the historic Outer Banks, to the quickly expanding role of the world press and the flights&#39; repercussions in war and military technology, Tise weaves a fascinating tale of a key turning point in the history of flight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
