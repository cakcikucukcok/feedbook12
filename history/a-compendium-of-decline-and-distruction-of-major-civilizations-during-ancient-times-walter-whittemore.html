  <title>A Compendium of Decline and Distruction of Major Civilizations During Ancient Times - Walter Whittemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My purpose in writing this compendium of ancient civilizations was to give a clear understanding of the major events which took place during ancient times so that junior and senior high school students would enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience teaching in the public schools for the past thirty-years, I found most texts to be very wordy, cumbersome in their intent to express historical facts, and most of all, their immersion to detail instead of concentrating on the highlights of intrigue, fascination, and personal biography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the elements which should be concentrated on so that students do not become bored reading historical material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History should be an enjoyable experience for those who wish to learn about the past and how it has affected the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, with this intent in mind, this author has embarked on a journey into the past to give enjoyment to those students who long to learn what the future will bring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
