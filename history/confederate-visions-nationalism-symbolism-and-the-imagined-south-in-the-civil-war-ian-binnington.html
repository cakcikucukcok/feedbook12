  <title>Confederate Visions: Nationalism, Symbolism, and the Imagined South in the Civil War - Ian Binnington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationalism in nineteenth-century America operated through a collection     of symbols, signifiers citizens could invest with meaning and understanding. In     &lt;i&gt;Confederate Visions,&lt;/i&gt; Ian Binnington examines the roots of Confederate     nationalism by analyzing some of its most important symbols: Confederate constitutions, treasury     notes, wartime literature, and the role of the military in symbolizing the Confederate     nation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nationalisms tend to construct glorified pasts, idyllic pictures of     national strength, honor, and unity, based on visions of what should have been rather than what     actually was. Binnington considers the ways in which the Confederacy was imagined by antebellum     Southerners employing intertwined mythic concepts-the &quot;Worthy Southron,&quot; the &quot;Demon Yankee,&quot; the     &quot;Silent Slave&quot;-and a sense of shared history that constituted a distinctive Confederate     Americanism. The Worthy Southron, the constructed Confederate self, was imagined as a champion     of liberty, counterposed to the Demon Yankee other, a fanatical abolitionist and enemy of     Liberty. The Silent Slave was a companion to the vocal Confederate self, loyal and trusting,     reliable and honest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The creation of American national identity was fraught     with struggle, political conflict, and bloody Civil War. &lt;i&gt;Confederate Visions&lt;/i&gt;     examines literature, newspapers and periodicals, visual imagery, and formal state documents to     explore the origins and development of wartime Confederate nationalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
