  <title>How the French Saved America - Tom Shachtman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Americans today have a love/hate relationship with France, but in &lt;i&gt;How the French Saved America&lt;/i&gt; Tom Shachtman shows that without France, there might not be a United States of America.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the rebelling colonies, French assistance made the difference between looming defeat and eventual triumph. Even before the &lt;i&gt;Declaration of Independence&lt;/i&gt; was issued, King Louis XVI and French foreign minister Vergennes were aiding the rebels.  After the &lt;i&gt;Declaration&lt;/i&gt;, that assistance broadened to include wages for our troops; guns, cannon, and ammunition; engineering expertise that enabled victories and prevented defeats; diplomatic recognition; safe havens for privateers; battlefield leadership by veteran officers; and the army and fleet that made possible the Franco-American victory at Yorktown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly ten percent of those who fought and died for the American cause were French.  Those who fought and survived, in addition to the well-known Lafayette and Rochambeau, include François de Fleury, who won a Congressional Medal for valor, Louis Duportail, who founded the Army Corps of Engineers, and Admiral de Grasse, whose sea victory sealed the fate of Yorktown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This illuminating narrative history vividly captures the outsize characters of our European brothers, their battlefield and diplomatic bonds and clashes with Americans, and the monumental role they played in America&#39;s fight for independence and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
