Mandeville wrote a book about his voyage around the world that became a beacon that lit the way for the great expeditions of the Renaissance, and his exploits and adventures provided inspiration for writers such as Shakespeare, Milton, and Keats. By the nineteenth century however, his claims were largely discredited by academics. Giles Milton set off in the footsteps of Mandeville, in order to test his amazing claims, and to restore Mandeville to his rightful place in the literature of exploration. &lt;br&gt;&quot;Erudite, witty and adventurous&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Mail on Sunday&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;The Riddle and the Knight&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant piece of detective work.&lt;/p&gt;" />
