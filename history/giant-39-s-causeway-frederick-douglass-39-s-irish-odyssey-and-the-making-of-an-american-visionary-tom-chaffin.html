  <title>Giant&#39;s Causeway: Frederick Douglass&#39;s Irish Odyssey and the Making of an American Visionary - Tom Chaffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1845, seven years after fleeing bondage in Maryland, Frederick     Douglass was in his late twenties and already a celebrated lecturer across the northern United     States. The recent publication of his groundbreaking &lt;i&gt;Narrative of the Life of Frederick     Douglass, an American Slave&lt;/i&gt; had incited threats to his life, however, and to place     himself out of harm&#39;s way he embarked on a lecture tour of the British Isles, a journey that     would span seventeen months and change him as a man and a leader in the struggle for     equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first major narrative account of a transformational episode     in the life of this extraordinary American, Tom Chaffin chronicles Douglass&#39;s 1845-47     lecture tour of Ireland, Scotland, and England. It was, however, the Emerald Isle, above all,     that affected Douglass--from its wild landscape (&quot;I have travelled almost from the hill of     &#39;Howth&#39; to the Giant&#39;s Causeway&quot;) to the plight of its people, with which     he found parallels to that of African Americans. Writing in the &lt;i&gt;San Francisco     Chronicle,&lt;/i&gt; critic David Kipen has called Chaffin a &quot;thorough and uncommonly     graceful historian.&quot; Possessed of an epic, transatlantic scope, Chaffin&#39;s new book     makes Douglass&#39;s historic journey vivid for the modern reader and reveals how the former     slave&#39;s growing awareness of intersections between Irish, American, and African history     shaped the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience accelerated Douglass&#39;s     transformation from a teller of his own life story into a commentator on contemporary issues--a     transition discouraged during his early lecturing days by white colleagues at the American     Anti-Slavery Society. (&quot;Give us the facts,&quot; he had been instructed, &quot;we will take care of the     philosophy.&quot;) As the tour progressed, newspaper coverage of his passage through Ireland and     Great Britain enhanced his stature dramatically. When he finally returned to America he had the     platform of an international celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawn from hundreds of letters,     diaries, and other primary-source documents--many heretofore unpublished--this far-reaching tale     includes vivid portraits of personages who shaped Douglass and his world, including the Irish     nationalists Daniel O&#39;Connell and John Mitchel, British prime minister Robert Peel, abolitionist     John Brown, and Abraham Lincoln.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Giant&#39;s     Causeway&lt;/i&gt;--which includes an account of Douglass&#39;s final, bittersweet, visit to Ireland     in 1887--shows how experiences under foreign skies helped him hone habits of independence,     discretion, compromise, self-reliance, and political dexterity. Along the way, it chronicles     Douglass&#39;s transformation from activist foot soldier to moral     visionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
