  <title>Up the Missouri River with Lewis and Clark - Bill Markley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lewis and Clark&#39;s Corps of Discovery expedition conjures up images of high adventure. &lt;I&gt;Up the Missouri River with Lewis and Clark&lt;/I&gt; tells of the beginning stages of the United States&#39; first overland expedition to the Pacific Ocean. The men had to contend with shifting sandbars, treacherous currents, submerged trees, mosquitoes, rattlesnakes, wicked weather, disease, and unpredictable new people. Meet the men of the expedition-deserters, drunks, sergeants, and hunters. See how the first four months of their journey transforms a loose group of individuals into Clark&#39;s Band of Brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Bill Markley has a wonderful talent for writing nonfiction with just a twist of humor. Though he takes his facts from the journals of Lewis, Clark, and other expedition members, his own commentary emerges.&quot;-Pat Decker Nipper, Author of &lt;I&gt;Love on the Lewis and Clark Trail&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;You will enjoy reading Bill Markley&#39;s description of Lewis &amp; Clark&#39;s expedition. He knows the stories, and shares with us a clear view of the expedition&#39;s journey. His book helps his readers better understand the Corps of Discovery&#39;s many and diverse encounters on the Missouri River.&quot;-Bill Stevens, President, Encounters On the Prairie, Central South Dakota Chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation&lt;/p&gt;" />
