  <title>That Ever Loyal Island - Phillip Papas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Of crucial strategic importance to both the British and the Continental Army, Staten Island was, for a good part of the American Revolution, a bastion of Loyalist support. With its military and political significance, Staten Island provides rich terrain for Phillip Papas&#39;s illuminating case study of the local dimensions of the Revolutionary War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papas traces Staten Island&#39;s political sympathies not to strong ties with Britain, but instead to local conditions that favored the status quo instead of revolutionary change. With a thriving agricultural economy, stable political structure, and strong allegiance to the Anglican Church, on the eve of war it was in Staten Island&#39;s self-interest to throw its support behind the British, in order to maintain its favorable economic, social, and political climate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the conflict, continual occupation and attack by invading armies deeply eroded Staten Island&#39;s natural and other resources, and these pressures, combined with general war weariness, created fissures among the residents of &amp;#8220;that ever loyal island,&amp;#8221; with Loyalist neighbors fighting against Patriot neighbors in a civil war. Papas&amp;#8217;s thoughtful study reminds us that the Revolution was both a civil war and a war for independence&amp;#8212;a duality that is best viewed from a local perspective.&lt;/p&gt;" />
