  <title>Rebels on the Great Lakes - John Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1863–1864, Confederate naval operations were launched from Canada against America, with an unexpected impact on North America’s future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, a myth has persisted that the hijackers entered the United States from Canada. This is completely untrue. Nevertheless, there was a time  during the U.S. Civil War  when attacks on America were launched from Canada, but the aggressors were mostly fellow Americans engaged in a secessionist struggle. Among the attacks were three daring naval commando expeditions against a prisoner-of-war camp on Johnsons Island in Lake Erie. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These Confederate operations on the Great Lakes remain largely unknown. However, some of the people involved did make more indelible marks in history, including a future Canadian prime minister, a renowned Victorian war correspondent, a beloved Catholic poet, a notorious presidential assassin, and a son of the abolitionist John Brown. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The improbable events linking these figures constitute a story worth telling and remembering. &lt;i&gt;Rebels on the Great Lakes&lt;/i&gt; offers the first full account of the Confederate naval operations launched from Canada in 186364, describing forgotten military actions that ultimately had an unexpected impact on North Americas future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
