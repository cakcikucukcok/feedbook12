  <title>The First Modern Campaign: Kennedy, Nixon, and the Election of 1960 - Gary A. Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this engaging book, Gary A. Donaldson tells the story of Kennedy versus Nixon with a sharp eye for the salient political developments and a keen sense of the drama of an election that was unlike any other the nation had experienced. The election of 1960 was an orchestrated political drama, organized as a sweeping campaign from coast to coast and staged for a national television audience. This made it the first modern campaign in which the television media changed the dynamics of presidential politics and in which photographs, charisma, and direct appeals to voters counted as they had never done before. It was also an election of intense personal rivalry made all the more spirited by the prejudice against Kennedy&amp;#39;s Catholicism and his intention to widen the American political arena. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The First Modern Campaign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is essential and engaging reading for anyone interested in contemporary politics in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
