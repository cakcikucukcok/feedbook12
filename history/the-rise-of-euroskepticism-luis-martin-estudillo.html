  <title>The Rise of Euroskepticism - Luis Martin-Estudillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Covering from 1915 to the present, this book deals with the role that artists and intellectuals have played regarding projects of European integration. Consciously or not, they partake of a tradition of Euroskepticism. Because Euroskepticism is often associated with the discourse of political elites, its literary and artistic expressions have gone largely unnoticed. This book addresses that gap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking Spain as a case study, author Luis Mart&amp;#237;n-Estudillo analyzes its conflict over its own Europeanness or exceptionalism, as well as the European view of Spain. He ranges from canonical writers like Unamuno, Ortega y Gasset, and Zambrano to new media artists like Valeriano L&amp;#243;pez, Carlos Spottorno, and Santiago Sierra. Mart&amp;#237;n-Estudillo provides a new context for the current refugee crisis, the North-South divide among EU countries, and the generalized disaffection toward the project of European integration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eclipsed critical tradition he discusses contributes to a deeper understanding of the notion of Europe and its institutional embodiments. It gives resonance to the intellectual and cultural history of Europe&#39;s &quot;peripheries&quot; and re-evaluates Euroskeptic contributions as one of the few hopes left to imagine ways to renew the promise of a union of the European nations." />
