  <title>Into the Tunnel - Gotz Aly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A generous feat of biographical sleuthing by an acclaimed historian rescues one child victim of the Holocaust from oblivion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the German Remembrance Foundation established a prize to commemorate the million Jewish children murdered during the Holocaust, it was deliberately named after a victim about whom nothing was known except her age and the date of her deportation: Marion Samuel, an eleven-year-old girl killed in Auschwitz in 1943. Sixty years after her death, when Götz Aly received the award, he was moved to find out whatever he could about Marion&#39;s short life and restore this child to history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what is as much a detective story as a historical reconstruction, Aly, praised for his &quot;formidable research skills&quot; (Christopher Browning), traces the Samuel family&#39;s agonizing decline from shop owners to forced laborers to deportees. Against all odds, Aly manages to recover expropriation records, family photographs, and even a trace of Marion&#39;s voice in the premonition she confided to a school friend: &quot;People disappear,&quot; she said, &quot;into the tunnel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gripping account of a family caught in the tightening grip of persecution, &lt;i&gt;Into the Tunnel &lt;/i&gt;is a powerful reminder that the millions of Nazi victims were also, each one, an individual life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
