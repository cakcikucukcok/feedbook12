      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;James Connolly served in the British Army for seven years but would go on to lead the 1916 Irish Rising against British rule in Dublin.

His goal was a socialist Workers&#39; Republic. In the United States Connolly joined the IWW in 1905 and campaigned across the country with the Socialist Party for Eugene Debs for President.
