  <title>The Elbow - John Gilpin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Experience Calgary&#39;s history through the story of its &quot;other&quot; river. In this revised and updated edition, John Gilpin delivers the definitive history of the Elbow River and the vital role it has always played in the lives of Calgarians. Drawing upon a rich archive of historical documents, photos, and maps, Gilpin takes readers on a sweeping journey through Calgary&#39;s past, from the founding of Fort Calgary to the creation of the Glenmore Reservoir, which unlocked the city&#39;s potential for growth.
Along the way, you&#39;ll meet many of the mavericks who shaped the Calgary we know today, and you&#39;ll discover the Elbow&#39;s outsized role in the city&#39;s growth. The Elbow River was the axis of Calgary&#39;s early development, and the battleground for its early feuds. Gilpin concludes by bringing the floods of 2013 into historical context, reminding us that Calgary has always had a complicated relationship with the Elbow as both a benefactor and a threat." />
