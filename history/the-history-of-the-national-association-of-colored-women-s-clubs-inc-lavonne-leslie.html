&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Edited by LaVonne Jackson Leslie

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    In highlighting the history of the oldest black womens organization in the United States, The History of the National Association of Colored Womens
    Clubs, Inc., written by scholar Dr. Charles Wesley, provides a comprehensive insight into the historical achievements and activities of the organization
    from its creation to 1984.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The book offers an interesting history of how the organization evolved and functioned nationwide into one of the most respectable black organization.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    It is highly recommended for readers interested in understanding the role of black women in uplifting the black community through community service
    involvement with programs focusing on childcare, education, and social services. The clubwomen established local, state, and regional chapters nationwide.
    The History of the National Association of Colored Womens Clubs, Inc., utilizes the organizations conference reports, minutes, and National
    Notespublication, as primary sources to depict how the clubs carried out their goals and operated in society to make a difference.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The voices of the pioneer women in the National Association of Colored Womens Clubs, Inc., can be envisioned by reading this pivotal work. Their
    achievements are noteworthy in our history. They have inspired women in the organization to continue to be involved in carrying out its mission by
    upholding its motto, lifting as we climb. This book prepares the foundation for the next edition focusing on the history of the organization to the
    present.
