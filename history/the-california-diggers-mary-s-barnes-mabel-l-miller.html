  <title>The California Diggers - Mary S.  Barnes, Mabel L.  Miller </title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The California “Diggers” A History of some Primitive Californians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In  the Santa Clara Valley, near the southern end of San Francisco Bay,  some five miles south of Stanford University, there stands a fine old  deserted abode, formerly a well-known station on the road from the Santa  Clara Mission to San Francisco. Its owner, Don Secundini Robles, was of  the pure old Castilian stock, and he and his wife. Donna Maria, were  lord and lady for all the region round, and their house the center for  all the gay &lt;em&gt;rodeos&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fandangos&lt;/em&gt; of the valley. Now the  house is a ruin, Don Secundini dead, and Donna Maria, in poverty and  alone, lives in the village of Mountain View. But their name passes on  to fame among the Stanford students in connection with the Robles  Rancheria, a large, low-lying mound of earth some quarter of a mile away  from the old house, with that mysterious reputation attaching to it  that always hovers around an Indian mound. It has indeed an artificial  look, rising in the midst of the otherwise level valley; and the boys of  the vicinity assured us that there were plenty of skeletons in it. The  man who owned it said that when he first began to plow in that field he  turned up human bones, and added, &quot;You may guess I was scared.&quot; Indian  mortars and pestles from this same heap were found in the possession of  various neighbors, and the site altogether seemed promising for  exploration. So, with the permission of the owner, and with such  direction as could be given by a historian with an amateur interest in  archæology, some Stanford students began to explore the site...&quot; &lt;/p&gt;" />
