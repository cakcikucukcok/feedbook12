  <title>Boon Island - Stephen A. Erickson, Andrew Vietze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The wreck of the &lt;i&gt;Nottingham Galley&lt;/i&gt; on Boon Island and the resultant rumors of insurance fraud, mutiny, treason, and cannibalism was one of the most sensational stories of the early 18th century. Shortly after departing England with Captain John Deane at the helm, his brother Jasper and another investor aboard, and a skeleton crew, the ship encountered French privateers on her way to Ireland, where she then lingered for weeks picking up cargo. They eventually headed into the North Atlantic later in the season than was reasonably safe and found themselves shipwrecked on the notorious Boon Island, just off the New England coast. Captain Deane offered one version of the events that led them to the barren rock off the coast of Maine; his crew proposed another. The story&amp;#160;contains mysteries that endure to this day, yet no contemporary non-fiction account of the story exists. In the hands of skilled storytellers Andrew Vietze and Stephen Erickson, this becomes a historical adventure-mystery that will appeal to readers of &lt;i&gt;South&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Perfect Storm.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;" />
