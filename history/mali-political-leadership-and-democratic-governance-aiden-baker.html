  <title>Mali Political Leadership and Democratic Governance - Aiden Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mali Political Leadership and Democratic Governance. A Book on Mali, A History. France&#39;s long-term plan for Mali is remarkably short-sighted. The recent French military intervention in Mali focuses on &quot;restoring democracy,&quot; without any consideration for the political and economic problems that caused the government&#39;s collapse. The cumbersome colonial era-borders, erected by the French, dividing north and south Mali were significant in causing the conflict. Furthermore, French is the second official language, and the majority is not fluent. Almost 70% of Malians are illiterate, which seriously inhibits the state&#39;s democratic capacity. Mali&#39;s economy is also insecure. Apart from gold mining, all production companies are foreign owned. This further inhibits the government&#39;s ability to run the country because if several companies pull out, the state will lose the majority of its financing. It is hard to imagine a &quot;recovery&quot; for Mali without any attention to the major problems, which led to the destabilization." />
