  <title>The Man Who Never Was (Illustrated) - Ewen Montagu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily in June 1943, British counterintelligence agent Ewen Montagu masterminded a scheme to mislead the Germans into thinking the next landing would occur in Greece. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This daring and complex operation called for a dead body, dressed as a Royal Marine officer and carrying false information about a pending Allied invasion of Greece, to wash up on a Spanish shore near the town of a known Nazi agent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The corpse was discovered as planned, the officer&amp;#39;s documents examined and verified by German intelligence, and action was taken.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By any measure, the operation was a success, and likely saved many lives. Even two weeks into the invasion of Sicily, German leaders still believed that the main attack would be in Greece." />
