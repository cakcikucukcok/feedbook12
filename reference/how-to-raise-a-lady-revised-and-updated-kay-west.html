  <title>How to Raise a Lady Revised and   Updated - Kay West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The day she was born, you dreamed of all that lay ahead. You envisioned a gracious young girl—the sort &amp;nbsp;of daughter other parents admire—one who knows how to make charming conversation and when to hold her tongue. Polite and considerate, your daughter would know exactly how to behave, whether she was at the ballet with her grandmother or in the stands at a Friday night football game. But that tiny pink bundle wasn’t born knowing the finer points of being a lady. She needs your guidance . . . because honestly, she’ll never know how much perfume is too much or how much gratitude is too little if you don’t explain. Explore these timeless fundamentals of grace, thoughtfulness, and appropriate behavior, and pass along the lessons to your young lady in-the-making.&lt;/p&gt;" />
