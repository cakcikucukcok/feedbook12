Editors want good writing, so why can it be so hard to get published. &lt;i&gt;Writer&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt; helps make sense of that big question, offering the kind of straight-shooting advice writers needs. I bought my first copy over a decade ago and still feel grateful that I was able to send my first submissions without embarrassing myself. &lt;i&gt;Writer&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt; is an invaluable tool that I find myself recommending again and again.&quot; -Erica Wright, author of the novel &lt;i&gt;The Red Chameleon&lt;/i&gt; and poetry collection &lt;i&gt;Instructions for Killing the Jackal&lt;/i&gt;, as well as Senior Editor for &lt;i&gt;Guernica Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
