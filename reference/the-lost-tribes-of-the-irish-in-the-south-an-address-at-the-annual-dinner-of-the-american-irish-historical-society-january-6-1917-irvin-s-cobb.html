  <title>The Lost Tribes of the Irish in the South / An Address at the Annual Dinner of the American Irish Historical Society, January 6, 1917 - Irvin S. Cobb</title>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The after-dinner address of Mr. Irvin S. Cobb of Kentucky&amp;mdash;so well known throughout the length and breadth of the land as an American of Americans and writer of vivid stories of American life, throbbing with pathos, alive with infectious humor, keen observation and dramatic force; as a war correspondent and picturer of the naked horrors of war; as a lecturer and general publicist&amp;mdash;will be hailed with interest and pleasure everywhere. The American Irish Historical Society does itself the honor of issuing the address in this form in advance of its appearance in the Quarterly Review of the Society, that it may be more widely known and the facts it sets forth more widely grasped. It treats its subject&amp;mdash;the Irish share in the early upbuilding of the Southern States-in a masterly way, in direct line with the Society&amp;rsquo;s motto, &amp;ldquo;To make better known the Irish chapter in American history.&amp;rdquo;" />
