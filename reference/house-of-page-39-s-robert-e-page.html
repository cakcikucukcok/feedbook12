He published CAROLINA PAGEs in 1990 which was about his PAGE line that arrived in Virginia in middle 1600s as they moved to North Carolina, then South Carolina, then Georgia, then Florida where he was born.

Photographs are provided of the many English houses that the PAGE family lived in beginning in early 1400 to date." />
