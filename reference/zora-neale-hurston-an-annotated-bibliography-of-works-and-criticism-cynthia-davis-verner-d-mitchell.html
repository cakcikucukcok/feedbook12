  <title>Zora Neale Hurston: An Annotated Bibliography of Works and Criticism - Cynthia Davis, Verner D. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zora Neale Hurston (1891-1960), the most prominent of the Harlem Renaissance women writers, was unique because her social and professional connections were not limited to literature but encompassed theatre, dance, film, anthropology, folklore, music, politics, high society, academia, and artistic bohemia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Zora Neale Hurston: An Annotated Bibliography of Works and Criticism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; consists of reviews of critical interpretations of Hurston&amp;rsquo;s work. In addition to publication information, each selection is carefully crafted to capture the author&amp;rsquo;s thesis in a short, pithy, analytical framework. Also included are original essays by eminent Hurston scholars that contextualize the bibliographic entries. Meticulously researched but accessible, these essays focus on gaps in Hurston criticism and outline new directions for Hurston scholarship in the twenty-first century. Comprehensive and up-to-date, this volume contains analytical summaries of the most important critical writings on Zora Neale Hurston from the 1970s to the present. In addition, entries from difficult-to-locate sources, such as small academic presses or international journals, can be found here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
