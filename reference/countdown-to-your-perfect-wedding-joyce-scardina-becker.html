  <title>Countdown to Your Perfect Wedding - Joyce Scardina Becker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Planning a wedding can be an exciting, overwhelming, and time consuming endeavor. COUNTDOWN TO YOUR PERFECT WEDDING will give brides the exact amount of information they need to plan the wedding they want. It breaks down pre-wedding tasks into manageable bits of information and serves as a point-by-point checklist so that nothing slips through the cracks and nothing is left undone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other books, COUNTDOWN is arranged on a 52-week timeline (one year is the average amount of time brides take to plan a wedding) that explains what needs to be done when. Each week will feature an essential aspect of a beautiful wedding and will include tips and insider information on how brides can get what they want, budgeting considerations, definition of terms, as well as feature information for &quot;Brides On A Budget&quot; and &quot;When Money Is No Object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For brides who wish they could hire a wedding planner but can&#39;t afford one, this book will hold their hand through the process so they can plan the wedding of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
