  <title>Think on These Things - Linda F. Garry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These poems arose from taking a different look at my life and my surroundings, after suffering severe injuries from a fall.  For a time, I could not see the light of day, but then my spirit was touched and I was elevated to see life differently.   Writing about my newly-found life was therapeutic and ignited sources of inspiration, observation and elation for me.
Look around and take the time to see, listen and hear the quietness of your soul and let it speak to you.  Find peace, happiness and joy in what you discover and think on those things.  Live in the present - in the moment of absolute consciousness  and see what you are doing right now and appreciate your life, the air you breathe, the nature that you see, the people who love you and the nameless person by whom you pass. 
It is my hope that you will enjoy reading my poems as much as I enjoyed writing them.
Thank You." />
