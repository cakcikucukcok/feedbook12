  <title>Bicycles: Love Poems - Nikki Giovanni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In her legendary career, artist and activist Nikki  Giovanni has established herself as a writer who can entertain and challenge,  and a voice for social justice who can inform and inspire in times of  national crisis. Controversial, revolutionary, ethereal, or illuminating, her  poems about race, Black lives, violence, gender, and family move readers of  all ages and backgrounds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With  BICYCLES, she&amp;#8217;s collected poems that serve as a companion to her 1997 LOVE  POEMS. An instant classic, that book--romantic, bold, and erotic--expressed  notions of love in ways that were delightfully unexpected. In the years that  followed, Giovanni experienced losses both public and private. A mother&amp;#8217;s  passing, a sister&amp;#8217;s, too. A massacre on the campus at which she teaches. And  just when it seemed life was spinning out of control, Giovanni rediscovered  love--what she calls the antidote. Here romantic love--and all its  manifestations, the physical touch, the emotional pull, the hungry heart--is  distilled as never before by one of our most talented poets. In a time of  national crisis or personal crisis, this is a collection that will open minds  and change hearts as only the best art can. &lt;/p&gt;          &amp;#160;       &lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
