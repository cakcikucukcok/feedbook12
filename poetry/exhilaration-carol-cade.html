  <title>Exhilaration - Carol Cade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you ready for Exhilaration? Do you want to experience cheerfulness, elation, gladness, high spirits, hilarity, a rush, galvanization and inspiration?
All of the above is available to you in my book..along with some other feelings I have not included, so you have some surprises left.
But, in all seriousness I will quote from my poem:  Hearing
For the poetry I write
Is for all mankind
To bring everything that helps living be full, free and full of grace.
Within the pages of my book it is my desire that I will have achieved to touch my readers hearts and souls as they look inside themselves and ponder on my words, or maybe just sit back with a nice cup of tea or coffee and be entertained.
There is a wide variety of topics I have covered in this, my second book. I am sure you will find one or two, or perhaps three that will be favorites and will draw you back again and again.
Confucious says: Words are the voice of the heart.
Then, may MY words leave footprints in YOUR heart." />
