  <title>I Saw Another Butterfly - Joseph Aron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;J O S E P H  YO S S I  A R O N&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;(1947-2010)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Yossi Aron was born in 1947 in Satumare, Romania and spent his fi rst 4 years
in Linz Displaced Persons Camp, Austria. In 1951, at the tender age of 4, Joseph Aron
and his parents arrived in New York and settled in Boro Park. Josephs parents, Holocaust
survivors, worked tirelessly to give him a fi ne Jewish education and a love of family. As a
young boy he was privileged to sing with Cantor Moshe Kusevitskys Choir at Temple Beth-
El. Josephs love for Jewish music and abilities as a Cantor enabled him to be the High Holy
Days Cantor for some years at the Baldwin Jewish Center. His work as an airline consultant
took him to over 100 countries where he helped modernize their airline industries. Josephs
interest in the native culture endeared him to many people. Until the last moment of his
life, Joseph never forgot the tragedy the Holocaust brought upon his own family and Jewish
people and worked tirelessly to ensure that their memory will never be forgotten. While
bravely fi ghting his devastating illness, he managed to complete this poem book just before
he passed way in July 2010 at the young age of 63.&lt;/p&gt;" />
