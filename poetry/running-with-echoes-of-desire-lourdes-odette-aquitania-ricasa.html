  <title>Running with Echoes of Desire - Lourdes Odette Aquitania Ricasa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Lourdes Odette Aquitania Ricasa is an artist and a world traveler. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She loves to paint and took painting lessons at the Mission Renaissance Art School in Pasadena, California, in Biarritz, France, Alicante, Spain and Bishkek Kyrgyzstan. She has on display more than one hundred works of art.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Wandering from one moment to the next from Vanuatu to Tasmania and then perhaps she will be back to Vanuatu, sometimes with a sudden crisis of the heart, in which she does not act or react. Some unconscious choices how a particular individual behaves, leading to a drama of psychological inclination.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Running with Echoes of Desire is a clear exercise of her talents, a special type of poetry for readers. For without love, without poetry, we become squeezed in social conventions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Destined to satisfy our literary cravings, a fleeting movement, a magnetic power has exerted a distinct influence in the art of her writing.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The book jump starts our imagination. It tells us about life. Words that shine to new truths. It contains more than two hundred fifty poems and newsletters and her Art sketches.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Excitingshe prefers to stay at the Paradores of Spain, chains of Palaces in Santiago de Compostela, Leon, Ducal Palace of Lerma, Trujillo and the Posada Dos Loios de Evora in Portugal. These places immortalizes yesterday, where the past emerges when Kings and royalty stayed here.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There were times, she stayed in dorm beds in Iceland and Lake Baikal, Siberia. She quips It was so much fun. I made a lot of friends.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Having traveled to two hundred eleven countries, her book is a premiere show case, the world on pages begins in her journeys. At times telling us what we do not already know or somehow we never framed the way she expresses it.&lt;/P&gt;
