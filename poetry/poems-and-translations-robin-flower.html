  <title>Poems and Translations - Robin Flower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;amp;lt;div&amp;amp;gt;First published in 1931, Robin Flower&#39;s enchanting lyric poetry combines with his translations from the old, medieval and modern periods of Irish literature. &#39;Mr Flower&#39;s poetry has loveliness and spontaneity. Though, as his sonnets prove, he can respond to the spell of rich lines and moulded thought, his whole bent is lyrical and individual. Beauty and love are almost all his song - they have the spring-like clearness of the Irish poets whom he translates.&#39; - Glasgow Herald &#39;He is of the company of those scribes whose glosses it has been his delight to refurbish.&#39; - Spectator &#39;To my mind, one of the most beautiful books of poetry published this century - here is a collection that will creep into people&#39;s hearts like the memory of wind, of birds singing in childhood, of first meetings, and the last words before death.&#39; - Richard Church, Fortnightly Review THE AUTHOR Robin Flower was Deputy-Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum from 1929 to 1944 and a lifelong visitor to the Blasket Islands in Kerry. His books include the Catalogue of Irish Manuscripts in the British Museum (Vol.II, 1926), The Western Island (1944), The Irish Tradition (1994) and a translation of The Islandman (1934) by Tomass O Criomhthain.&amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;gt;" />
