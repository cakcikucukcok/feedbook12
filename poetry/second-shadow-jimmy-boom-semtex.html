  <title>Second Shadow - Jimmy Boom Semtex</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jimmy Boom Semtex&#39;s new poetry book is a real hot one. Full of cutting edge work on many things from current affairs (Selfie), animal rights (Dog Munchers) to war (Colonies Die) to Jimmy&#39;s childhood memories (Siloth) to sex (Tessa&#39;s Thighs) to suicide (Eight Decades) and much more.   This is Jimmy&#39;s most varied book yet topics wise. There is also a section with short stories, reviews and more in it. This is complimented by a photograph section of Lada cars, Jimmy&#39;s old school classroom, now in ruins, food and drink and other cool things.  Check out this collection that includes haiku and rhyming work.  An example is: Orange I remember the big orange coloured car from when I was a kid at Siloth. Seeing the stop cars smash up and crash. The trucks crashing into one another were cool. One could only turn one way. Bang! Revving engines and broken vehicles. Debris on the ground. Me, a kid. There with my parents on the old airfield. Orange car." />
