  <title>One Size Fits All - shirley binkley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1990, one of Shirleys good friends took note of her beautiful prose in letters and suggested Shirley consider writing professionally. At first, it sounded like a crazy idea, but as soon as Shirley started writing, the words flowed. Since that day, she has written hundreds of poems and songs, been published many times, and even won awards.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wrote Chapter One of her collection, One Size Fits All, several years ago, and wrote Chapter Two recently at the age of eighty-one, disturbed by the ugliness spewed during the American presidential campaign. Barely recognizing her beloved country, she wrote with fury and passion while expressing her emotions regarding the anger and protests that occurred.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this collection, Shirley invokes raw emotion as she tells stories of inspiration, discusses God, and tries to guide the reader down a right path. She utilizes humor, charm, and sometimes fury, depending on the word journey. Her poems encompass multiple genres while her words are sincere, factual, and honest, intended to open the eyes and soothe the soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
