  <title>A Walk Beyond the Horizon - T.S.J.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was lucky to have grown up in the 50ies era. I lived in
a small town, not very far from where Im living now. I never
did like traveling! Born at the end of the year, my dad called
me his good luck baby. Id like some of that luck to strike me
right about now. I have two sisters, one older, one younger,
yes Im the middle child.
I attended Catholic school Saint Michaels, until high
school. It was at St. Mikes that I became fond of poetry. We
memorized many. many poems. That was their way I guess, it
worked. I love to read the work of the great poets still.
From high school to the alter, I married just shy of
eighteen. The Lord was very good to us he gave us three of
his most precious gift s I had a daughter and two sons. They
were then and are now the loves of my life.
Now that Im older I see things through a bigger picture
window, I dont want to come off sounding like my parents
but as I remember it they oft en would say It can only get
worse. Looking now through the glass, I would have to
agree." />
