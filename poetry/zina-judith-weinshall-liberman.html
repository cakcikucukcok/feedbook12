  <title>Zina - Judith Weinshall Liberman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book affords English-speaking readers their first opportunity to read and enjoy the poetry of Zina Weinshall.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Zina was born in Russia in 1900 and moved to Israel in 1920. Early on, she wrote her poetry in Russian, her mother tongue; later, after she had mastered the Hebrew language, she wrote her poems in Hebrew, the language of her adopted land. Through this translation of Zinas poetry into English, poems from both groups are now accessible to western readers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Seventy-eight of the poems in this book represent three separate collections of poems which Zina had printed as small books between 1929 and 1944 for distribution to family and friends. The poems have been left in their sequence as organized by Zina herself within each of the collections. Also included in this book is a poem Zina wrote after losing her son in war in 1948.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In addition to Zinas poetry, readers will find a large collection of family photographs assembled by the editor, Zinas daughter, Judith Weinshall Liberman, and the editors comments about each photograph, both captivating and enlightening.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The editors preface to the book, as well as her essays about the life and writings of Zina Weinshall, round out the picture, and help the reader gain insight into a unique poet.&lt;/P&gt;" />
