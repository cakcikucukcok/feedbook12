  <title>Relentless Thoughts - Austin Branstetter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poetry book shows an inside look into my mind as I was going through manic depressive episodes and recovering from them. It is rough and loosely edited to keep the authenticity. Only the layout of the poetry itself has been touched. 
The basic emotions of humanity are subject to dissection in every section. My thoughts on the human condition are prevalent throughout my journey into and out of madness, along with the general nature of the world around us. Momentary blips of insight can be found, as well as constant messages of doubt and disbelief. These writings are meant to provide people suffering from mental illness some form of catharsis knowing there are others living through similar conditions
Nothing Austin has created is as raw and emotional as this book, and it shows in every line

An authentic, poignant, and necessary insight into a talented, young mans experience with the cycles of life
