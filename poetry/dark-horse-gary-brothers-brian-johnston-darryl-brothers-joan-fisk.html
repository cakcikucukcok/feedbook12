  <title>Dark Horse - Gary Brothers, Brian Johnston, Darryl Brothers, Joan Fisk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thought provoking and emotionally inspirational, this poetry is truly a &quot;new age&quot; style.
Gary was born to middle class parents in the very quiet west end of Toronto, Canada in 1950. His home bordered the Etobicoke ravine where he grew up playing hockey on its open-air creek. He eventually graduated high school two years early because of academic achievements. He went on to marry and have two beautiful children and moved to a rural Ontario town to raise them. He coached and played hockey for years until the children were grown.  His writing came forth naturally and has followed him to his early retirement, as he built his dream home on a lake with one of his best friends. It has been a rocky road at times, but the writing that has emerged from it all is truly inspirational." />
