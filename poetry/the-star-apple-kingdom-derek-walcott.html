  <title>The Star-Apple Kingdom - Derek Walcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most of the poems in this new collection follow the arc of the Caribbean archipelago from Trinidad to Jamaica. The reader is taken on an odyssey, beginning with &quot;The Schooner &lt;i&gt;Flight&lt;/i&gt;,&quot; in which a poor mulatto sailor abandons his life in Trinidad, sailing northward to meet his fate, and ending with &quot;The Star-Apple Kingdom,&quot; a long poem whose axis is the crucial attempt to establish a new social order in Jamaica without sacrificing democracy. Other poems speak through various personae: &quot;Koenig of the River&quot; marks the end of a saga of nineteenth-century exploration and conquest through the Conradian image of a missionary-soldier whose comrades have been lost at sea; &quot;The Saddhu of Couva&quot; describes the lament of an Indian priest for a fading spirituality; &quot;Egypt, Tobago&quot; places Mark Antony on a beach in the glare of afternoon. Two poems are dedicated to fellow poets--Josephy Brodsky and Robert Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Star-Apple Kingdom,&lt;/i&gt; Walcott&#39;s precise and inventive imagery is enriched by frequent exploitation of the tonal aspects of dialect. He has absorbed into poetry the normal resources of fiction--to the point where fact crystallizes into metaphor. As John Thompson recently commented in &lt;i&gt;The New York Review of Books: &lt;/i&gt;&quot;Walcott writes now as a man who knows exactly what he is doing. His style is that of the best language of our period.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
