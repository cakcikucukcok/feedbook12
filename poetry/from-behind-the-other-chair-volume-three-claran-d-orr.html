  <title>From Behind the Other Chair, Volume Three - Claran d’Orr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;From a traumatized psyche pours the therapeutic poetry of a licensed marriage and family therapist. As a trauma survivor herself, author Claran dOrr speaks to the hearts of those affected by mental illness in From Behind the Other Chair, her gesture of peace and healing. This is the third of three consecutive, autobiographical volumes of poetry. They begin with the present, flowing backward in time to the original severe traumas she experienced of commitments to a mental ward and jail sentences to the mental health unit of a correctional facility.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Poetry is her therapy. By telling her tragic story, she hopes to touch the soul of others with the tenderness of a fellow wounded spirit. Her poetry reaches into the depths of the nightmares of the mentally afflicted who are locked in a prison of their own making. Because she could neither defend herself nor comprehend what was happening to her, her world became surreal and horrific as she spun into a madness she could not control.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;From Behind the Other Chair&lt;/i&gt;, she speaks to the awful damage she endured and her response to the baffling and dangerous conditions surrounding her.&lt;/P&gt;" />
