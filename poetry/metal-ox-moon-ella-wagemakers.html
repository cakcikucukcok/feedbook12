  <title>Metal Ox Moon - Ella Wagemakers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Metal Ox Moon, the author&#39;s second poetry collection, refers to her Chinese zodiac signshe was born in the Year of the Ox, and her element is metal. The poems, though, are far from metallic in character. She dubs this book a reluctant collection because of the uncertainty in her desire to have it published.
Excerpt of a review of Sorrows of the Chameleon:
Interesting inclusions are several haiku, senryu, tanka and a haibun, which combines haiku with travelbound prose. . . . Wagemakers succeeds in transposing her expatriate Filipina verses into exhalations of the eye, as a sigh of an insight. . . . Her mild sorrows are . . . universal, however acutely personal, and thus charming with many skins and colours. I look forward to more of her delicate poetry." />
