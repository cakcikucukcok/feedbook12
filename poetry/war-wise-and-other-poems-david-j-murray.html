  <title>War-Wise and Other Poems - David J. Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written with language that works in harmony with the rhythm of the poems, seasoned poet David J. Murray offers his third collection of work in &lt;i&gt;War-Wise and Other Poems&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt; 
Presented in two parts, the first set, War-Wise, contains thirty-five poems reflecting Murrays memories of life in Manchester, England, during World War IIa war that began when he was two years old. Emitting clear and powerful imagery, some of the titles are straightforward narrative. Others are more reflective and address the effect the Holocaust had on his eight-year-old mind.&lt;p&gt; 
In Ghosts, Murray combines the innocence of childhood with the violence of war.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;In Sunday School, we sometimes drew&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;Pictures whose innocence shone through&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;The spattered lines of gunshot fire&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;That dotted and dashed each page entire&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;Until, on the page, a Messerschmidt&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;Was finally and firmly hit&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;And fell in flames into the blue&lt;/CENTER&gt; 
&lt;CENTER&gt;Of our crayond sea; we drew no crew.&lt;/CENTER&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
The second collection, One Hundred Mood Studies, contains a set of short, stand-alone, rhymed sonnets, each expressing a modern-day emotional conflict. Exercises in the craft of formal writing, these poems provide an outlet for everyday shifts in emotions." />
