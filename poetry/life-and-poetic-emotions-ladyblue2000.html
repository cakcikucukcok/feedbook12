  <title>Life and Poetic Emotions - LadyBlue2000</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started writing many years ago. At fi rst it was
just mental therapy for me. My doctor, very
great psychologist told me that if I wrote my
feelings down on paper that it would help me
feel better and cope with whats bothering me
in my head. I suffered many horrors in my life
and I needed a way cope and live a normal
life. Well my life isnt exactly normal as you will
read. And neither are some of my poems. The
question for me to ask is anyones life really
normal? I wanted my life to be written so that the future generations of my
family will know about me. And will know of how I became the person that
I ended up to be. By accident I realized that I could write poems of many
kinds. A guarantee that you will laugh and sometimes cry and even learn
from my poems. Of how to love, heal, cope, laugh, cry, live and get even
through my poems.
Many of my friends online around the world give me subjects to write about.
To be their words for them to speak to others. To help, to Heal, to dream,
reasons to live and reasons to want to pray. And reasons to not want to die.
I thought to myself that if Im going to be a writer that I dont want to let one
subject to be untouched. To speak out words that I feel need to be heard
through my poems. I want my book to be of help to others for whatever needs
they have. And I pray with my whole heart that you get something good out
of what you are about to read. And whether you believe it or not you will
fi nd in my book of something that you might need written in one or more of
my poems. And the life story is to help you know that your life is better than
you may have thought. In my poems there is something for everyone. And that
means you. My e-mail is written in my book if you would like to write me or
even comment on my book. Weather good or bad happy or sad I would like
to know of how you feel." />
