  <title>Life&#39;s Experiences - Bennique Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born on Saturday August 7, 1982 on the beautiful island of New Providence, she was blessed Bennique Inderria Brown, the second of three children. Her early education began at Lady Bird Preschool, and then she attended St. Cecilias Catholic Primary, St. Annes in Eleuthera for one term, Aquinas College, H. O. Nash, and then graduated at the C.R. Walker Senior High School.  Her tertiary education led her to The College of the Bahamas where she obtained a Bachelors Degree in Secondary Education, specializing in English Language and Literature. Presently she is in pursuit of a Masters Degree at The College of The Bahamas in Reading with concentration in Inclusive Education. Though she has attended various learning institutions, she was sure to leave her footprints in the sand. She was involved in track and basketball teams, dance ministry, choir, Bahamas Jr. Red Cross, Technical Cadets, Rotaract Club, and The Education Awareness Society.&lt;br&gt;
She was taught from a very early age about religion. Moreover, her years of dedication to the Pentecostal Ministry provided her the opportunity to serve on the usher board, sing on the praise team and combined choir. She has learned that in all things you must put God first and in return he will give you the desires of your heart. &lt;br&gt;
One such desire of hers is to become an international public speaker addressing the youths of this nation to follow their dreams. She is definitely well on her way to accomplishing this dream as she is a part of an International Organization that has enhanced her public speaking and communication skills. She joined the Toastmasters organization in 2005, and during that time has held the positions of Secretary, Vice President of Membership, Vice President of Education and President." />
