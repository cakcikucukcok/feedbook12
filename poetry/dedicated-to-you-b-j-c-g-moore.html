  <title>Dedicated to You - B.J.C.G. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dedicated To You &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a compilation of works, dedicated to friends, and acquaintances that I have met over the years of my life. So many different people, races, creeds, genders sharing so many of the same issues. So many similarities in health, personal and religious problems. Problems with their spouses, their jobs, their children, their weight and their fi nances. Wars, world hunger, cancer, aids and so many, many things that one cant even begin to imagine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the greatest words in any dictionary, in any language is &lt;i&gt;hello. &lt;/i&gt;Hello is the beginning of many great relationships of all kind, love affairs, and business deals, bonding of nations, and mending hurt feelings and clearing up misunderstanding. A sincere hello followed by a real conversation putting all agendas on the table could prevent many misunderstandings and conflicts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A sincere hello could make people look at each other as human beings, and see that under all of our pretenses, isms, bigotry and hate we are more alike than we can imagine." />
