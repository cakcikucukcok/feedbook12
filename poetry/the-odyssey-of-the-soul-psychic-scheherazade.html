  <title>The Odyssey of the Soul - Psychic Scheherazade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Doorway to Illuminations
A strange kind of energy was vibrating and whirling through my soul in the early hours of 1 March 2007, raising my normal body frequency. An unusual heat shot up through my body and I was aware of a strange heartbeat. 
I felt as if I were dying or having a heart attack and I was terrified as no one else was with me. The time was 3 am. 
Instead of reaching for a glass of water I grabbed a pen and writing pad and sat up in my bed, without consciously exercising my mind.
The pen kept writing and scribbling then I started to hear certain words and phrases which I began to repeat out loud. It seemed as if hours and hours had passed and by this time I was so stiff that I could feel pain shooting up my spine.
By now I was alert, looking at the piles of paper filled with my scribbling.
I was about to collapse so I decided to go and make myself a cup of tea and wash my face. I felt normal again but to my astonishment I discovered that the time was by now 10 am! How on earth had I sat there all those hours without moving!
I looked at everything I had written. I couldnt believe it. I had never had any interest at any time in my life in language or poetry, and had never been able to produce fine words or phrases. Yet I had managed to produce an extraordinary poem. 
My mind was in disbelief. I was so tired and utterly baffled. The next day all my friends and family were shocked at how such a powerful poem had come out of someone like me as I wasnt even born in this country.
After a week, another poem came. I was given these two poems for my life story book. 
I asked whoever was around one night: why and how and who? I remembered that Id had a dream in November 2006 in which my father, who passed away in 2003, told me that a special gift would be given to me and for serving humanity!
That was the start of the series of poems which I began writing in March 2007. Up to the present time still more poems have been coming through: I currently have a total of over 40 poems  all a gift for humanity.
I was instructed to do no more works with  individuals but that instead I would  need to put my new power and psychic energy to more constructive use for the millions who are in turmoil and in grief and sorrow with all their complications and emotional love traps and more of the dark time which all of us have to go through at some stage of this decaying life.
I was also told that it is not my subconscious mind  as psychology explains to us: this is a fancy word they use, yet where does that subconscious  reside? 
Call it whatever you like  it is not important as its the result which counts: the truth of our evolved spirit within the soul energy which gives us solutions  happiness, understanding and unseen intelligence and the iron hand which pulls us out of the black hole of ordinary life with its awesome delusions and earthly domesticated matter 
It is very important to remember because you are free from every earthly conditioning: you have received a gift. The free spirit is an evolved, illuminated being and progressed mind  though not intellectually cultured.  
That message will be carried  with every second I breathe and I shall bring it and give it to all humans who will search one day to discover who they are and why we are born and what the true goal is, but with a free mind and heart.
 	Here are the collection of that gifts of inspiration which I received from the higher being which is far wiser and more intelligent than any human born and any ordinary intellect. 
Read on and think. We have a collection of poems dictated by the Illuminators (the Emperor of the Soul). You can order it if you want to read them.
Many thanks for your time to read the true words of my heart.
