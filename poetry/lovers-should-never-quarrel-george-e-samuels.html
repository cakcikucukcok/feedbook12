  <title>Lovers Should Never Quarrel - George E. Samuels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Lovers Should Never Quarrel&lt;/i&gt;, his seventh collection of poetry, author &lt;b&gt;George E. Samuels&lt;/b&gt; shares his heart and seeks to help others share theirs. His poetry of love expresses those thoughts we want to communicate to our mates and family. He explains that the universe is full of love and that it is a waste of time for everyone to quarrel when what they really want to do is love each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is a pure emotion that exists like a single thread among all of us and beyond that knows no bounds; we must simply embrace love and nurture it. Tell your loved ones that you love them, and try to never quarrel. This poetry collection offers a path directly to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Loving Song&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being of one is the being of another&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Leaving one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only to be with another&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Only smiles and laughter make you feel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have what you have been after.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A very special Love&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A touch of your lips warm waves, vibrations of breath&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Kisses when you came&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Kisses when you left playing that&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Song forming a place of Love&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A place of care, Loving cant be wrong&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For loving is a Song. &lt;/p&gt;" />
