  <title>So Pretty…. so Many Tears - Rose Portillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;This book was written out of the feelings and some of the most&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;sadness out of the depths of my heart and soul. It contains feelings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;from different times and many events of my life. So Pretty, So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Many Tears has poems from many different emotions I have felt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;throughout my life. Some of the poems that are written in this book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;were written when I was 16 years old, although I have been writing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;since I was much younger, when I had already been physically and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;emotionally abused! Then I lost &quot;The Love Of My Life.&quot; I fell in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;love with Tony when I was 12 years old. We got together when I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;was 16 and then we separated for a few years because of my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;We got back together when I turned 24 and he was 25 years old. A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;couple of days before he turned 27 years old, he passed away; yes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I lost my love, I lost my life, hence I lost my mind. When I finally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;gave my whole self to him and finally stopped worrying about what&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;my family felt about him. Ever since then I have been truly going through years of so much denial of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;his death, self conviction and guilt over what happened and how it happened. I sank into the &quot;Abyss&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;of my empty soul,&quot; and I didn&#39;t want to be found because I knew deep inside if I found myself deep&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;within my secretly wounded heart, I would realize and find out that I lost the only love I had ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;He was my only friend and I knew that I would lose my mind if I ever lost him. There was no way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;that I wanted to live in this ugly world without him by my side, and I had told him that I would never&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;be afraid of anything not even the end of the world, so long as he was there by my side even when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;the end of the world was occurring. I have been abused most of my life, first by my mother, then by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;my older brother, then later on when I got married to someone else other than my true love; I went&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;through some inner hell tortures as well as physical tortures, with my husband always on drugs, such&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;as heroine, crystal meth, and crack cocaine; when I didn&#39;t even know what all that stuff was or what&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;it did to someone. Anyhow, the book contains all of my dreadful, melancholic, horrific details of just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;how much I had lost my mind. For I truly did lose my mind when Tony left my world. The only thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I had to stay alive for was my children that I already had and when &quot;The One I Loved&quot; left my world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I went insane but I didn&#39;t even know it, and neither did anyone else for that matter. I really didn&#39;t&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;know how to handle living life without Tony. I needed to learn how to live again not only for myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;but for my children, and the book does indeed hold the deepest fears, tears, and loves in my life. The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;book contains so many feelings tears and love and as one person put it, &quot;So Pretty So Many Tears&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;when the tears wouldn&#39;t stop and how I couldn&#39;t stop thinking of and wanting to die! Like I said, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;actually really lost my mind. There are many different poems in this book; some are regarding abuse,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;death, love, reincarnation and even living with physical pain as I do now and have been ever since the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;year of 2001; it seems as if once the denial stopped and the admission of Tony being dead occurred,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;the pain and suffering I had secretly been feeling in my heart and my soul, suddenly spurted out of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;me and showed and was now felt physically. For the secret I was holding within me was the secret&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;I withheld even from my own self and that was that Tony was dead. I was full of secrets all of my&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;life, first I held the secret from my family the love I had for Tony; he was my secret love. Then, I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;held the biggest secret from myself; the death of Tony&#39;s body but not the death of my love for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;There are also some poems from my granddaughter Vanessa Espitia and from two of my daughters,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Desiree Grace and Princess Anna, both of whom I encourage to write all their thoughts and feelings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;from their heart, if that is what they want to do. Most of my 12 children are blessed with the talents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;of writing and art; along with some of my grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Pretty&lt;/p&gt;" />
