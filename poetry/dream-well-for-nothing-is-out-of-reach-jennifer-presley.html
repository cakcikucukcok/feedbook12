  <title>Dream Well for Nothing Is out of Reach - Jennifer Presley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;These poems are to maintain your lightness of being. They are for moments when you could use reminding that there is more to life than what the seemingly mundane world has to offer. Combining depth and subtle inspiration, they speak about a way of being our souls recognize, but our conscious minds forget to embrace always. They echo &lt;i&gt;Rumi&lt;/i&gt; in their simple lines reflecting our inner relationship to the Divine. They mirror the essence of awaken consciousness leaders like &lt;i&gt;Eckhart Tolle, Dr. Wayne Dyer, and Dr. Deepak Chopra&lt;/i&gt; They all speak about living beyond ego, into Real Being and co-creating our life with an awareness of Who We Really Are.  This leading edge of information coming from many directions, both from new and very old sources, is becoming a wave of understanding causing a critical mass of change in how we think and feel about our ordinary reality. This book of poetry reflects these ideas beautifully. It holds elements of truth that can be understood equally through the language of science, world religion and the general society alike.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let the Divine pour through my essence into you, until you see how you were never alone, even before me. I am the living embodiment of Source come to hold you with all the tenderness and depth of love that exists, awakening you to know that this too, is you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt; How we feel is more important than simply what we think. Understanding is vital, but to be in alignment with our desires, we must clear up the depths of how we feel. Our assumptions affect how we navigate in this world, and the quality of both what we receive and of what we give to others, immediately and in the broader sense of existence. &lt;i&gt;As above, so below&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;microcosm, macrocosm&lt;/i&gt;, even &lt;i&gt;in heaven as on earth&lt;i&gt; all reflect this truth we have been given in so many forms through the ages. Being reminded of these things is the purpose of this poetry.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;My bliss spills over my lips and I am unable to contain the unbounded possibility such joy gives me. You are a gift of light illuminating my true essence, awakening Source within me by your presence and laughter.&lt;i&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Written in two sections, it focuses on the quality of life in how that is felt, which governs most of our behaviour regardless of how left brained we are focused on being. The first section is &lt;i&gt;On Love...&lt;/i&gt;, since that is the bond between us all, in so many forms and expressions. That is our fundamental connection both to each other and to the greater whole being of the living universe, whether you call that God, Goddess, the Divine, Source energy, whatever name you give to the nameless.&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt; I feel your presence with me. Make room for me in your life, you whisper. My heart opens with joy knowing my soul has found beauty to nestle with &amp; flourish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt; The second section &lt;i&gt;...and Other Things&lt;/i&gt; includes all other topics from being in nature to the nature of manifestation of both our dreams and ordinary realities. It has simple observations of life and glimpses of the greater truths in small things that those who are awakening have begun to notice more. As we focus our attention on what is important, nuanced mirrors reflect back to us elements of ourselves in so many forms. We see, if we are open, pieces of us in everyone. This gives us a deeper understanding of not only ourselves, but of all life. &lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Standing still enough so that all of me is motionless, there is no reason to hug the trees. They reach out to touch me as a new member of the forest gently welcoming me into their collective feelings of joy and belonging. The breeze lovingly caresses around our core stillness as we softly deepen into the earth.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;P&gt;" />
