  <title>Footprints of the Queen Without a Crown - Ricardo Galvan Barquin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Footprints of the Queen without a Crown, represents itself, the most important poetic work in the incipient literary career of the author. Written among some unique corners of Canada and surrounding areas: British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario, this book has been the greatest display of unrestrained inspiration, admiration and love for life and women, that the poet has embodied through letters and, where metaphors are broken with the solemn chant lost among words. Emerging from a sudden romance within long hours of snowy solitudes, this poetry will achieve, between sounds and cadences, to unfold the reader to a sudden emotional revolution, where there will be no space for logic, and where death does not matter anymore, but inspire and praise to the end, because it is through the language of the soul in which we really understand our existence Love is like the cigarette of the poet, often inspiring and almost always kills, its absence tend to exasperate, you can throw and tread on it, or enjoy it until it fades off" />
