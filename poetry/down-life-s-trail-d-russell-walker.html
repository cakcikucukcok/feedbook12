  <title>Down Life’S Trail - D. Russell Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For more years than most of todays population could possibly recall, I had been writing poems about my family, my own true adventure stories, and just about anything of interest to me, which has been just about anything! I had catalogued, shelved, boxed, and stored material throughout the years all the while that I had been experiencing the many facets of my more varied than some life. From the time that I was a little farm kid, the workings of nature and its wild faces had held intrigue to my mind. Consequently, by the time that I became old and bold enough to begin my own quest of adventure, I just plainly let it happen. 
Any opportunity to explore life and of things not yet known to me became open season for my whims. In those early years, I had managed to scribble down numerous discoveries that evolved as I waded through lifes happenings. Eventually, I had accumulated many written utterances and at first kept them in piles and eventually files. Through the urgings of family and friends, it has come to the point of sharing my writings of adventurous ramblings with others. But where should I start? The grab bag of writings that I have dealt from for this first widely published volume of mine, which I had decided to name Down Lifes Trail, for in many ways, it does reflect selections written by myself along the bumpy road of life. 
At the age of twenty-two, I had started out on my own after schooling for the profession as a photographer. This required traveling many miles, first within Maine then to other locations across the country, and involving aerial photos along with all others. I had recorded and kept records of many of the special locations that I had flown over or photographed, both in writings and photos. Now has come the time for me to pursue the publishing of some of my collections. I had promised to my local audience that had been reading my work over the years that I would indeed take a shot at publishing a book of poetry. My decision (right or wrong) is now to begin my offerings with this aptly named volume of Down Lifes Trail, for the following has been derived from short story poems written as I was tripping along lifes trail. Hopefully, you will read and enjoy the enclosed pages that have been randomly selected from the far reaching trail of my life." />
