  <title>Long Shadows at Noon - John Marshall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Long Shadows at Noon is a short collection of poetry and prose that addresses the richness and tragedies of life. Life has its many rewards that are often overshadowed by the pace at which modern life has captured our minds, time and attention.
&lt;p&gt;The shortest and darkest day of the year is the winter solstice that occurs on the 21st of December. This dark period often seems to sneak up on us with little notice or warning and we find ourselves longing for more pleasant times. Often we reflect during the deepest days of darkness on how we let another year slip through our fingertips without enjoying the recently departed summer and autumn. Life is similar. During the dark periods of our lives we often look back at happier times and long for their return. During these dark days of the solstice and of life we must remember that each new day is a little brighter and warmer. Better times are ahead and life is far too sweet not to enjoy.
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other poetry books Long Shadows proceeds each poem with a short essay as to its nature and motivation for being written. Life, death, love and passion are addressed in various styles and forms. Both the simplicities and entanglements of living from a mans perspective are brought forth with an emphasis on taking a truthful and deep exploration of the soul." />
