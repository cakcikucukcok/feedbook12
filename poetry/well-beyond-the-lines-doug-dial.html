  <title>Well Beyond the Lines - Doug Dial</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where&#39;s God
When the seasons of testing are doubly extended
and the day you so long for comes not.
The prayers that you pray
seem to just simply stay,
by the door of your lips.
Where&#39;s God?
When that which you&#39;ve hoped in seems now to be futile
and all you&#39;ve put faith in goes flat.
The goals you desire
consumed in the fire.
While the aching heart chants,
Where&#39;s God?
When years of firm values are now all a shaking
and all that was clear turns to haze.
You&#39;re losing your standing.
All sides are demanding.
The answer. The answer.
Where&#39;s God?
When finally you come to the end of all struggling.
The worries, the doubts; the fears cease.
You lie at His feet
Christ&#39;s presence so sweet.
To the quiet and believing,
there&#39;s God!
