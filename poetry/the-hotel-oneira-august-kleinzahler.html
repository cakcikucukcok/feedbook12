  <title>The Hotel Oneira - August Kleinzahler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thrilling new collection from one of the most original poets of his generation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;His work is a modernist swirl of sex, surrealism, urban life and melancholy with a jazzy backbeat.&quot; That praise appeared in the pages of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; in 2005, but it applies no less to August Kleinzahler&#39;s newest collection.&lt;br&gt;     Kleinzahler&#39;s poetry is, as ever, concerned with permeability: Voices, places, the real and the dreamed, the present and the past, all mingle together in verses that always ring true. Whether the poem is three lines long or spans several pages; whether the voice embodied is that of &quot;an adult male of late middle age, // about to weep among the avocados and citrus fruits / in a vast, overlit room next to a bosomy Cuban grandma&quot; as in &quot;Whitney Houston,&quot; or that of the title character in &quot;Hootie Bill Do Polonius,&quot; who is bidding &quot;&lt;i&gt;adios compadre&lt;/i&gt; // To a most galuptious scene Kid&quot;--Kleinzahler finds the throbbing human heart at the core of experience. &lt;br&gt;     This is a poet searching for--and finding--a cadence to suit life as it&#39;s lived today. Kleinzahler&#39;s verses are, as noted in the judges&#39; citation for the 2004 Griffin Poetry Prize (which he won for his collection &lt;i&gt;The Strange Hours Travelers Keep&lt;/i&gt;), &quot;ferociously on the move, between locations, between forms, between registers.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Hotel Oneira&lt;/i&gt; finds Kleinzahler at his shape-shifting, acrobatic best, unearthing the &quot;moments of grace&quot; buried under the detritus of our hectic, modern lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
