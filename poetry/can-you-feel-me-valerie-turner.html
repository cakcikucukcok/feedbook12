  <title>Can You Feel Me - Valerie Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Can You Feel Me&quot;? An emotional, sensual, reflective journey through life, love and the endless pursuit of happiness illustrated through poetry and prose. I began writing at the age of nine as the result of a difficult home life. Writing became an outlet of expressing the feelings and thoughts that no one wanted to hear, but that everyone at one time or another has felt. 
I fell in love with the power of the written word after having to memorize the Langston Hughes poem &quot;Dreams&quot; in the third grade. I felt the truth in each phrase and the inspiration in each word to hold fast to dreams. I wrote and directed my first play Lets Kick the Statistics at the age of 15 and a second play &quot;What Did He Do Wrong&quot;, an anthology of predominantly African American poetry and prose at the age of 18. Although, I took a hiatus from writing to start a family, it was always my desire, my dream, to one day write something that would touch the world, and make it cry tears of understanding. To influence the masses reflect on the ways they have felt or have made others feel." />
