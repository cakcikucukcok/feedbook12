  <title>Lucio’S Poems - Lucio Presutti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his new poetry collection, author Lucio Presutti draws on his life experiences, trials, and tribulations to present a unique philosophical view on historical events, human behavior, and current experiences. From the search for romance to the loss of our most revered president, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, he captures of the heart and soul of the emotional depth of each experience. Compelled strongly by the theory of duality, he believes our forces in nature and life itself invariably touch and mould the intrinsic nature of all human beings.
There is a deep and profoundly spiritual resonance in his writings. Though he has experienced a tumultuous life, the inherent optimism in his life is evident in &lt;i&gt;Lucios Poems.&lt;/i&gt;  
&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where Are You?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
My passion, my love, Ive yet to meet
I feel you there, here, Somewhere
For you my heart, thumps a romantic Beat
And lays my soul such yearning care
OH! How I picture your sweet embrace 
and the taste of your warm sweet kiss
such beauty I vision in your lovely face
To cast me in loves sweet bliss.
We are destined by cupids fate
Two soul mates yet to be
a building crescendo to a lovers haste
that your sweet eyes, will always look for me
my romance lies barely constrained
as I search to find that girl I do
till then everyday is such a lonely pain
OH! My sweet true love, where are you?&lt;/i&gt;" />
