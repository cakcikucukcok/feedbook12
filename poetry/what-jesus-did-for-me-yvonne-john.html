  <title>What Jesus Did for Me - Yvonne John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Jesus Did For Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the title of my book and the very first poem I wrote. I went through a period of depression, brought on by tormenting voices in my head. At the time, most of the people around me associated the depression with Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D), as it mainly seemed to affect me during the winter months. It wasnt until I became a Born Again Christian that I discovered that the problem was actually spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time that I suffered from depression, I lost all my confidence and self-esteem. I had no hope. I became nervous and fearful and I wanted to give up and die. The voices made me believe that I was no good, I was useless, but most of all, that I was a wicked and bad person. I got to a point where I didnt recognise myself anymore. I had always considered myself to be good person; reliable, dependable, kind, thoughtful, and caring. Suddenly, I was told I was somebody different. This became too much for me to bear. Even worse, the voices told me that God would reject me, He would never love me and He would turn me away if I went to Him. Being raised as a Catholic, I believed that God loved everyone, so I was absolutely devastated when I believed that I was not good enough to be loved by God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight months after becoming Born Again, the Holy Spirit would visit me during the early hours of the morning. He would minister words of peace and comfort to me. This brought healing to my pain. I now feel safe, secure, and significant. I now know that I have purpose to my life. My poems seek to edify, encourage and inspire other readers, and to let them know that Jesus not only changes lives, but He also heals brings peace, joy, hope and comfort into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My book is written in a poetic style. My poems depict my journey to salvation and illustrate how I have grown and matured in Christ. As you read through my poems you will experience the sense of new hope, strength and joy that God has given me through having a relationship with Jesus Christ. Every one of my poems was Holy Spirit inspired to bring comfort and healing, but many of them also serve as words of wisdom, warning, direction and praise. They also show how God inhabits the praises of His people, and how ones praise can completely change your circumstances around. Allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you as He ministered to me as you read through the pages of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Jesus Did For Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
