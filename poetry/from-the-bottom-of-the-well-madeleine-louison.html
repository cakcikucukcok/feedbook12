  <title>From the Bottom of the Well - Madeleine Louison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the bottom of the well is a collection of inspirational poems that demonstrates a protagonist that speaks about her life experiences and how the enemies kept her at the bottom of the well. Having trust in God, she survives life until deliverance. Jesus raises her from the bottom to the horizon without experiencing the middle aspect of life. 
Jesus appears spiritually in front of her, precisely where she was standing at the bottom of the well, and delivers her from all her pains and sufferings, her neck and shoulders bending to the ground in profound thoughts.
She was overwhelmed with frustration and shame, and it overpowered her, but she maintains faith in Jesus and hopes one day he will deliver her, walk toward her, smile at her, and observe her. That he will stretch out his arms toward her and revive her, fill her life with Holy Spirit, and strengthen her.
She lies across his hands like a letter T. He blows air on her, infuses her spiritual realm, and throws her to the surface of the well without achieving any wisdom from the middle aspect of life.
She believes her life has revealed that the last is the first, the bottom is the surface, and the dust raises the poor." />
