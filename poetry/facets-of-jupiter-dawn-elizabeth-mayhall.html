  <title>Facets of Jupiter - Dawn Elizabeth Mayhall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Facets of Jupiter&lt;/i&gt; presents a new collection of poetry written by a girl who was born one of seven children in a small town on the outskirts of New Orleans, Louisiana. Her earliest memories were of her mother, who had a gift for ceramics and pottery and who lovingly shared her gift with her daughter. This planted a small seed within this creative old soul.
Born as the archer, the hunter ruled by planet Jupiter. When I was a child, I would drift away like the clouds. In the morning, I would wake up, and it was as if the wind, rain, Sun, all the elements were calling my name. I spent hours playing and daydreaming. My imagination was vast and whimsical. I would divide the sky into sections with my mind; it was mine, and all mine. What gave me such entitlement, I will never know, but this is what unlocked the creative soul. Facets of Jupiter, is a collection of poetry that takes you on a journey through the eyes of a woman, a mother, and most of all a lover of life. I was born to create, not to destroy. It is only through my creations, such as this collection, that I truly can be free.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beautiful Sunrise&lt;/b&gt;
Beautiful sunrise
Envelopes my soul;
Brings me to your open arms.
I watch your sun-kissed skin,
Building sand castles.
I sit in awe of your charms,
Your laughter, your smile.
Beautiful sunrise
Envelopes my soul;
Brings you to my open arms.&lt;/i&gt;" />
