  <title>Tripping up the Basement Stairs Before Dawn - John Seymour Eldridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Seymour Eldridge began writing poetry and lyrics in Seattle, during the social revolution of the 60s, when the war in Vietnam was causing turbulent times in the lives of a generation of flower children around the world. The Spiritual leaders of that revolution, our poets and songwriters, were calling for profound changes from within the young men and women in their expansive, Self-aware audience. John Seymour Eldridge, known as Jack to his friends, became a conscientious objector to the draft. He was arrested and jailed by the FBI for his beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his release from prosecution by the ACLU, John lived on the beaches of Hawaii for a year. He was working as a fine dining waiter in the plush hotels of Kailua Kona on the Big Island. Responding to a job offer from the owners of Channel 13 Television, he returned to Seattle and became instrumental in the creation of a well-received Arts &amp; Entertainment Guide for Seattle/Tacoma and the greater Puget Sound area. His expertise was also tapped for work as a Talent Coordinator for Live Programming at the independent TV station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began a career in journalism, covering music and the arts, which encompassed editing and publishing several newspapers, producing video workshops for prominent authors, and the management of a Self-awareness book publishing company. Today, at the age of 70 years young, John continues to write poetry and lyrics, with warmth and sensitivity, that express the insights he has experienced on the Way of Being. This book, Tripping up the Basement Stairs before Dawn, is a result of his awakening. &lt;/p&gt;" />
