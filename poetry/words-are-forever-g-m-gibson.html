  <title>Words Are Forever - G. M. Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was never intended to be published. Some of these inner thoughts laced with deep erotic emotion have never been seen by anyone but me. It was a diary of thoughts that has been written for more than a decade. These are words of expression describing my inner thoughts with the men I have loved . Men I will always remember, men I know to this day. My first love is still my friend; we exchange cherished memories of family, of dating and sharing the experimentation of our first intimate relationship. It was a learning experience like no other and will be remembered for a lifetime. The love ran high and the hurt ran deep.
With time, came a more mature love with commitment, promises that were so strong you would have thought they would have lasted forever, but people change.  Some left behind gifts like children; others brought memories and broken hearts. But they all brought lessons.
And then one day you find chemistry with someone and quite possibly the love of your lifetime. There is nothing more powerful, more addicting, more mind blowing then someone who connects with you. There is nothing quite like the smell of a manespecially a man you love.
Forbidden Love is never for keeps. A man taken is not yours; however for stolen moments, for exchanged glances, secret touches and earth shattering experiences it is erotica to the highest power. It could quite possibly turn out to be the biggest heartbreak you will ever feel. 
As you look inside my open heart, I hope you will find one moment that takes your breath away.
And never regret a single touch." />
