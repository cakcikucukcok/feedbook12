  <title>Diaries Through the Eyes of a Woman - Patrice Flagg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Woman; Stories/Poetry pertaining to life experiences, life, love, friendships, life as I know it; This is in rhyme, words that ejected in such a way that express myself, my life as it was dealt. These stories are easily followed, mostly inspired by people and incidents in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In three sections;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section one; dedicated to my children, how very much they mean to me, answers to some of their many questions, some amusement, mostly my love of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section two: to my husband, my love, my emotions, my passion, our fashions, and my promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section three: to family and friends, the life as I know it; starting very early in life explained in the last story Kathleen; my sister &amp; Timothy my brother both died at a very young age. Life with them wonderful, their death unbearable. Another tragedy of a good friend. A story of wonderful friends. A word to my Mom for all she means to me. A diverse section of highs and lows all explained, easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally; Three short stories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrets &amp; Scars: A tells all tale of misery in a few relationships that caused me much pain and regret, why I settled for these situations?  Maybe out of insecurity, mostly nave, mainly putting trust where it did not have a place, with those who took advantage. Hopefully my coming clean will protect my nieces and nephews and other teens to better deal with relationships that have no real beginning so therefore cannot possibly carry the power needed to enforce life long respect and happy endings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A Word To My Unborn Child: Just in the case something should happen to me, life of my brother has been swept away without a whisper of goodbye. My new child it will be another son, I want to get the chance to tell him I love him, and let him know what I wish for him, and my other two sons, things that I will teach them myself but, just incase!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My Father: A very sick man with little time left, brings out the true feelings of anger, love, judgment that I held a lifetime.  Now I realize hes human, made mistakes; his love and I must let him know how very much I love him and forgive him and cannot bear to loose him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is a book that can be placed on anyones bookshelf, stories to be read to young children, poetry that can be enjoyed by women, and men too. Stories that can be lessons to teens, true stories that I went through with no happy ending until the real thing came along!  Thankfully I was not tangled in the wrong web where as to have missed out. Diaries from this Womans heart, once broken over and over and mended finally with reality, sense, and love!&lt;/p&gt;" />
