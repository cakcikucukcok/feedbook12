  <title>Dancing with the Moon and the Stars - Sylvia Stern</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poet Sylvia Stern enjoys walking and observing the sky. The sun brightens her mood and makes her smile. But a few clouds and her imagination can work together to see things other people wouldn&#39;t see. She loves the stars and imagines jumping between them. All of nature in the sky or on the ground is fascinating to her. In her collection, Dancing with the Moon and the Stars, she shares her observations of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are poems that take the reader on adventures with cloudsone of Sterns favorite topics. From the cold winter sky to the escapades of the fall leaves, her poems capture the magical essence of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come along on an adventure that might have you tasting parts of the sky in one poem or blowing the biggest bubble with bubble gum in another. Dancing with the Moon and the Stars is a poetic journey that considers nature in a different light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Wish for Wings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes I wish I could be a butterfly&lt;br&gt;
and when the time is right to make a change,&lt;br&gt;
I could zip myself into my little sleeping bag,&lt;br&gt;
have a nice, long rest and when I awoke&lt;br&gt;
I would be a gorgeous bug with wings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
