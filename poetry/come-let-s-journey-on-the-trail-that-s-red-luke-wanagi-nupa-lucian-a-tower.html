  <title>Come Let’S Journey on the Trail That’S Red - Luke Wanagi Nupa, Lucian A. Tower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=&quot;sitb-was-a-p&quot; style=&quot;text-indent: 18px;&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Have you ever stopped at a lake in the afternoon, and as you gaze into the waters did you notice your reflection? However, many of us do, but we use mirrors. Do we notice ourselves? We look and remember what used to be instead of what is now. These are memories, and they are moments of our lives that are never forgotten. Mostly the good times, the times of pure love, and the times of deep fear or trauma. Memories are meant to help us in life, even the bad ones. Well, some of you would disagree with me, I know this. However, the memory isnt anything but a reflection and the pain that some people feel associated with these pictures of the past, they are nothing but fear and anxiety. When you awaken are they there? The poet is someone who writes about memories, imagination, good and bad dreams, he listens to the language of the mind and spirit.&lt;/div&gt;" />
