  <title>Simply Speaking with God - J. Michael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Poet J. Michael suddenly found himself all alone in a difficult situation. As a spiritual person, he asked God to touch him in some special way that would bring purpose back to his life. He has found that purpose in writing poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he wrote poem after poem, he began to realize that he was telling a story of his life in poems. The prayer poems are similar to his own prayers, and there are poems that reflect his life experiences. The devotional poems focus on topics that he studied or taught in the past. His verses recall military service, work, travel, service to God, and other mundane and extraordinary experiences throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Simply Speaking with God &lt;/i&gt;is his testimony to his almighty God. Each poem tells a story and illustrates just how easy it is to talk to our heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;My True and Living God&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Father I know that You come to us daily,&lt;br&gt;
In all the things we see.&lt;br&gt;
For all things You created,&lt;br&gt;
We are forever grateful to Thee.&lt;br&gt;
To watch the sun rise,&lt;br&gt;
That gloriously adorns the day, &lt;br&gt;
It is so beautiful to see,&lt;br&gt;
Every inch of the way &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />
