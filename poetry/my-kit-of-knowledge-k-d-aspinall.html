  <title>My Kit of Knowledge - K.D. Aspinall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My poems are my My Kit of Knowledge, they were written over a period of 40 years. I would write a lot because words were always swirling around in my head.  My lack of education hampered me.  I didn&#39;t have much faith in my abilities.  Then I remembered my old school motto PERSEVERENCE GAINS HONOR&#39;, and no matter what, I persevered.  In August 2012 a feeling came over me, that I needed to share my poems, that it was my time to fly. I contacted Xlibris they became my launching pad. Xlibris is helping me to fly. My gratitude to them.  I am a mother of 5 children, 2 daughters, and 3 sons. My eldest child a son has passed away.  I have 10 mokopuna (grandchildren). I am in all of my poems, my children and mokopuna will have a lot of years to discover me. Have faith in your own ability to even achieve the
impossible.   Arohanui (big love ) Kate" />
