  <title>Our Best and Most Accomplished - Helen Ryan Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Have you ever thought about what makes the difference in successful child rearing especially when too many children, pre-teens, and teen-agers seem to have become victims of adults who have missed the mark? Were not referring only to non-caring adults and child practitioners but also those adults who seem to embody and embrace the qualities needed to produce caring, compassionate, involved, and accomplished children.  Why does it too often appear that our precious plants and animals get more of the best of us than do our children? Could it be perhaps, that plants and animals cant or dont resist us as do children; that they dont balk and sulk at the least admonishing, have no ax to grind and no prior knowledge or experience ( as some children have)  with the myriad of  negative forces into which they are born or become infused?  Plants respond to favorable stimuli or the lack thereof and animals may initially put up a good fight in the face of rigorous training, but after such rigorous and consistent training   coupled with the appropriate rewards, the results may be an animal who will do just as we have trained him to do. Now that is precisely my point;   Producing good plants, ones we want to admire and display in a variety of settings, ones we wish to maintain through their designated season(s), and ones we want to replant from year to year takes a great deal of nurturing on our part. Very few plants and flowers flourish (the way we want them to), void of perpetual care. Even weeds cant grow under the wrong conditions. Do you see where I am going here?  Plants that you choose to nurture will reward you from season to season and animals you desire to train or befriend will shower you with the level of affection equal to the level of quality training and time invested in them.  I did not say that they would not be productive for you and would not give you hours and years of pleasure without special attention, but I do emphasize that they will give you their best if they have received the best from you, their owners and caretakers.   &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A former principal of mine used to preface memos as gentle reminders for those tasks in urgent need of completion or attention.  I presume that it was her way of saying, without raising the ire of her staff that the due date on a project was fast approaching; therefore we needed to get moving toward its completion.  It was quite effective as far as I was concerned because you knew instinctively that she wanted to convey an important message without alienating anyone, and because of the firm but gentle tone employed in her memos, you gladly worked diligently to meet those all important lifelines (as I prefer to say) , not deadlines.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A Chinese proverb reads thusly, Govern a family as you would cook a small fish----very gently. Fish are very delicate flesh and must be handled with care especially when cooking. They will easily break or separate. Only certain utensils are most effective when turning the fish in a pan or on a grill.     Families are strong as a unit but each member must be handled with care which helps to prevent or reduce tension and or friction.   The message in Our Best And Most Accomplished is not new and certainly not one that has not already been conveyed in a multitude of venues in places all over the world.  It is not a re- invention of the wheel. Instead, it is a wheel which has been modified and stream-lined to reach more of the masses. Many have come before us and have inspired in us the desire to reach our highest good. Nothing could ever diminish the collective effect of individuals throughout history who have made a difference in the life of one person or in the lives of many.
