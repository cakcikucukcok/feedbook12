  <title>From the Heart of Me - Ethel Glenn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We experience situations in many different variances, verities, aspects and levels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a scenario of you lying in the bed and it&#39;s extremely cold. You do not want to leave your comfort zone. You are very hungry and ten feet away from you on the table is an apple. You want to get up and get the apple but it&#39;s just too darn cold.  So you go within and contemplate the different options you have of getting that apple without leaving your comfort zone. Now lets look at the options youve made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1.	You can get up from your comfort zone and get the apple.&lt;br&gt;
2.	 You can wait until someone come into the room and ask them for it.&lt;br&gt;
3.	You think I&#39;ll ask God to give it to me, and thats ok but lets examined this one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So you think to yourself it would be great if God would answer me by giving me that apple, after all He did say that whatever you ask for you can have.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now lets look at what happens in Heaven. God is delighted that you have raised your awareness a tiny bit.  He is overjoyed because you have given him an opportunity to help you grow closer to him and closer to recognizing who you truly are. So He calls all of heaven to your exhorted request.  He tells your spiritual guides, I want you to keep him wondering about that suggestion he has made, and angelic beings, I want you to help him learn of me from the outside of himself. Also try to see if he will accept the teachings of Jesus, Buddha, Mohamed or can he truly just believe from his heart; so that he may have some hard material to refer to if he falls into doubt.  
We got to teach him that God&#39;s life is ruled by law and order and he must work with Me to make his request available to him. He must believe and have faith, and he must trust that I am He and he is Me and that there is nothing he can&#39;t have if he would only align his beliefs with mine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We tend to think that God will help us if we are good enough and so that&#39;s what you get being good enough and struggle, burdened down emotionally; and when trials and tribulations occur you automatically think you did something that displeased your God. Look! God is not much concern with your worldly affairs. He is concern with your soul and you getting to know who you truly are so that you can know who He truly is. It is God&#39;s will that you call forth whatever you want. But you can&#39;t have it if you don&#39;t renew your minds and think like him; however, know yourself so that you can create like him, and know what exactly it is you want so that you can eventually come home to Him.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But when she realized what it would take to call the apple forth. She loss all hope and threw the blankets around herself tightly and went to the table and got the apple for herself. Too bad another missed opportunity for her to experience God&#39;s Magnificence and Abundance." />
