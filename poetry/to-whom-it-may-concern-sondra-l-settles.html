  <title>To Whom It May Concern - Sondra L. Settles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a writer I mainly focus on relationships. All the perils concerned with becoming involved in and maintaining a relationship with the opposite sex. As women, are emotional creatures they sometimes feel that they must have an emotional relationship before beginning a sexual relationship. While men are usually, more visual and physical by nature. They are turned on by physical contact and visual stimuli, but women need so much more then that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women need emotional and spiritual nurturing, while men tend to lack understanding in that area of womens needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the two come together, this tremendous lack of understanding causes an abundance of pain and heartache. Women are left feeling under-appreciated, neglected and unloved. Men on the other hand, usually dont understand what the problem is in the relationship. We often assume they will not understand; there is also a gap in communication, which furthers the stress we feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a writer I attempt to explain this pain and heartache that women so often go through because of these misunderstandings. But in the end, we MUST eventually turn to a real relationship with God in order to reach the fullest potential that life has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
