  <title>Second Chances: Worthy of Redemption - Kollin L. Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Second Chances: Worthy of Redemption is the follow-up to Humble Pie: A Gift from God. Anyone who has truly lived has probably made at least one mistake. In some cases, the mistake is something one has to learn to live with for the rest of ones life. If this blemish on ones lifes record doesnt result in public humiliation, it can at least serve as a thorn in ones side to help keep the person humble. Even when we forget and move beyond our transgressions, others will occasionally appear to remind us, and, in some cases, try to define us by who we were or by what we did or what was done to us.
Second Chances: Worthy of Redemption is about those of us who have made mistakes. Since we cant undo the past that added an imperfection or two to our lives, we have to learn and grow from our experiences and do our best to continue living without repeating our transgressions.
It is said that we never get a second chance to make a first impression, but we always have a chance to make a lasting impression.
