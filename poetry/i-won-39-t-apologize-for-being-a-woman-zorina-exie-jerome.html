  <title>I Won&#39;t Apologize for Being a Woman - Zorina Exie Jerome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Wont Apologize for Being A Woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a compilation of poetic testimonies from a feminine standpoint using urban Christian ideology.  In addition to questioning the 21st century church, Jerome boldly confronts real issues that most women struggle with as a Christian which according to Jerome, are grossly overlooked.  From subjects on dating to male/female friendships, I Wont Apologize for Being A Woman unveils shocking scenarios that end with a profound resolution on how to cope with it.  Men will have a better understanding of a womans viewpoint.  Women will be enlightened to re-evaluate their worth.  This book is designed to be voice of clout for anybody who can identify with being rejected or misunderstood.  It speaks to men and women of all nationalities.
