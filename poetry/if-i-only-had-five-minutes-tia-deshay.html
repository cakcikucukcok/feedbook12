  <title>If I Only Had Five Minutes - Tia DeShay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I remember attending an Open Mic session at a venue located in downtown Detroit. A poet took the stage and before reciting his piece, he said that a poet has five minutes to impact his or her audience either negatively or positively.  What a poet said in those five minutes could either create change or maintain the status quo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went home that evening and asked myself, What if, after five minutes, I could no longer write poetry for the rest of my life. What would I write in my last five minutes?  The answer?  If I Only Had Five Minutes. The Last Will and Testament of a Hip Hop Poet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I Only Had Five Minutes. The Last Will and Testament of a Hip Hop Poet is a three disc compilation: Life, Love, &amp; Rhymes. In 26 poems I speak his language, swallow her pain, dream my memories, and create our rhythm. In my five minutes I fill white space with unlimited possibility. In my five minutes, I write now, so others can remember later &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will you do with your five minutes?
