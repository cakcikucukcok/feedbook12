  <title>Poetic Ramblings of a Disenchanted Soul - Danny Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is like confetti in a strong wind. Much of its substance is dispelled as soon as it passes by our senses. The sad reality is that it often leaves much to be desired and even less to hold and cherish. The breaths of anticipation are the wishes and needs that stem from discovering a book, which may answer those deeply held frustrations for which there have been no optionsand often no solutions either. This book does not claim to provide any of the truths, which we all avidly seek, but only to impart some comfort in their reading that will alleviate those needs in other ways. Opened at any page at any time, a vista of change will reveal itself to you that will, at the very least, grant you a new level of awareness of the promises that good poetry can bring to you. Simple peace of mind and pleasure can be yours, and what more can you ask of life?" />
