  <title>Meeting of the Seasons - Katya Romanoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The poem Meeting of the Seasons conveys a philosophical message of an ultimate victory of youth and life over decay and death, employing universal metaphorical characters of the seasons: summer, autumn, winter, and springdepicted as four powerful women. The seasons represent different stages in any life cycle. The poem asserts that even though winter, summer, and autumn are all powerful and beautiful, and their powers should be acknowledged. Spring does something revolutionary and vital. Spring is the season that awakens nature from its winter sleep, reviving and rejuvenating all living things on earth. It is the most inspiring season. Within the poem, spring is representative of youth in ones life, and, therefore, is the strongest and most victorious of the four seasons. 
This poem is intended for children ages eight to fourteen and is accompanied by original-colored illustrations." />
