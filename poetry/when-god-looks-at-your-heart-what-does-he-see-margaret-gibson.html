  <title>When God Looks at Your Heart What Does He See? - Margaret Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was created in the beginning through the hand and mind of GOD.  When the time for GOD=s purpose and plan for my life arrived GOD placed me in the life of my dear parents, who are deceased, to nurture me in preparation for life=s journey in CHRIST.  I am the eldest child of their union and GOD blessed me to share my life with two brothers and two sisters.  Further, GOD has blessed me with two sons, a daughter, a daughter-in-law, three granddaughters, and a grandson, all of whom I cherish.  I am a native of New Orleans, Louisiana.  I now live in Irving, Texas.
At the age of twelve I made a commitment to GOD that I would learn all that I could so that when HE needed me I would be prepared to be used by HIM.  GOD gave me a quest for knowledge and I have attended colleges, universities, workshops, seminars and classes on subjects such as systems analysis, bookkeeping, social work, treatment of children who have been sexually abused, learning disabilities, advocacy for the disabled, real estate, sales, marketing, advertisement, counseling, law, travel and tourism, Microsoft office applications and much more. I have a Bachelor Degree in Sociology and a Juris Doctor Degree in Law.  I am a 1985 candidate in Who=s Who in America and 1986 in Who=s Who Among Professional and Business Women International.
Presently, I am developing a business incubation program, organizing a foreign mission network and writing books.  I am the Founder and President of Serving Others, Inc., a non-profit corporation.  I plan to pursue a doctorate degree in Jewish Studies and I am currently a member of a Messianic Jewish congregation.
I have spent more than twenty years speaking in prisons, homeless shelters, substance abuse programs, detention centers and on the streets.  I have witnessed to mothers outside of abortion clinics concerning their decisions to abort their babies.  I have been a volunteer in an AIDS hospice.  I have been called by GOD to be an evangelist, teacher, builder and intercessor in HIS Kingdom.  I have produced spiritual TV and radio broadcasting programs.  GOD has given me an international ministry and I will be traveling soon to The Gambia, Liberia, India, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, and Jordan.
I am who I am because of GOD=s grace and mercy.  I live to die to self so that the Glory of GOD can be displayed in my life.  I will never forget Calvary=s Cross because all of my sins, pain and sorrow were given to JESUS.  All of my heartache of this life is not to be compared with my salvation.
Whatever I achieve in this life I will always say, ATo GOD is the Glory!@" />
