  <title>Heart Speak - Dennis McCormack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Heart Speak&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of poetry that comes from deep within author Dennis McCormacks heart, seeking to address some of the ultimate questions in our lives: Is life eternal, and how does a person make up their mind about the answer to this question? Should the human person be the standard of values always? Can oceans heal us? Can Angels heal us? Can God and Man heal us? 
McCormack explores these questions and others in verse, relying on tradition handed down to him through both childhood and university study. The heart and the mind play a special role in poetry, in our lives, our marriages, friendships, civilizations, and filial relationships. The poet composes his song and poem as his heart and mind dialogue together finally finding unison when the task is done. Poetry and song come from the heart because they are inspired by it as a first step in the poems coming to be and be seen. 
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rain Falls on Heaven and Earth&lt;/b&gt;
Rain fell on roads not taken, 
Flowers blooming, blushing at friends, 
Celebrating love-springs birth,
On wise folk praising him 
With precious gifts for children,
Angels at their gates.
The day we met, tears fell, 
Blessing all of us, and your heart
Passing cups of hope 
To Gods friends at sea, 
As the old orange sun turned yellow
To the sounds of Shenandoah.&lt;/i&gt;" />
