  <title>My World of Poetry - Jonathan Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now you know about the people who played big roles in my life. Heres a brief description of my book. This book contains a collection of poems I wrote throughout my life. I did not put them in chronological order so the reader can figure out the puzzle of my life. Let me mind you I still didnt figure that puzzle out, and thats what this book is about. Finding yourself isnt the easiest so remember its the choices we make that define our lives. These are the choices I made the experiences I learned from. It takes a smart man to learn from his own mistakes but a wise man can learn from others. Everyone has an opinion on what life means to them.  These are my opinions because I believe if you can overcome the fear of death you can truly live life." />
