  <title>Sunday in the Body of the Garden of Tyme - I.B. Wingfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I intend to offer the reading society and individuals varieties of pieces to ponder. This book captures (thoughts) only what my spoken words cannot.
I believe that to obtain a balance in our minds and in our hearts we must explore the perimeters of our existence.From despair to happiness, we must look inside to inevitably know ourselves.
Literature is a quiet language of its own, that must be manifest in books. We must cherish literature.
The title: Sunday In The Body Of The Garden Of Tyme sums up a day in the life of the author that lasted twenty years. I assure you that he lived  the research. Is it poetry? Useless montage? You decide.
The subjects and ideas I represent are commonly grim or disconnected from hope. This book reveals my battles w/ in &amp; out. I do favor traditional styles of poetry. However, I am somewhat idiomorphic w/ these small stories. I fear God and am constantly learning things from the least mundane to the most divine.
True poetry never fills a page or a book -it forms a conscience far from the pages, far from our hands. I do wish that my readers find in this inaugural book: Humor, intellect, question and relevence -for these are scripts that we may all relate to in one way or another." />
