  <title>Simple Poems for Simple Times - Derrick Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is my second book; I wrote it the same way Ive written in the past. Im a simple writer. I write what I feel and what is on my mind. I dont want to change that because then I wont be comfortable with what Im writing. I write about things that Ive heard about, seen, or experienced personally. I was always taught that poetry was about expression, imagination, and feelings. Ive tried very hard to capture that in my books. When I see or hear about an incident, I often wonder what brought that person to his or her decision. Then I say, What would I do if it were me?
