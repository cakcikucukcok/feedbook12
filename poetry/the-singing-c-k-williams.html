  <title>The Singing - C. K. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New work from the Pulitzer-Prize winning author of &lt;i&gt;Repair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . Reality has put itself so solidly before me&lt;br&gt;there&#39;s little need for mystery . . . Except for us, for how we take the world&lt;br&gt;to us, and make it more, more than we are, more even than itself.&lt;br&gt;--from &quot;The World&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first volume since &lt;i&gt;Repair&lt;/i&gt;, C. K. Williams treats the characteristic subjects of a poet&#39;s maturity--the loss of friends, the love of grandchildren, the receding memories of childhood, the baffling illogic of current events--with an intensity and drive that recall not only his recent work but also his early books, published forty years ago. He gazes at a Rembrandt self-portrait, and from it fashions a self-portrait of his own. He ponders an &quot;anatomical effigy&quot; at the Museum of Mankind, and in so doing &quot;dissects&quot; our common humanity. Stoking a fire at a house in the country, he recalls a friend who was burned horribly in war, and then turns, with eloquence and authority, to contemporary life during wartime, asking &quot;how those with power over us can effect these things, by what cynical reasoning do they pardon themselves.&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Singing&lt;/i&gt; is a direct and resonant book: touching, searching, heartfelt, permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Singing&lt;/i&gt; is the winner of the 2003 National Book Award for Poetry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
