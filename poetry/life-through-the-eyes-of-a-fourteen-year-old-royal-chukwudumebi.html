  <title>Life Through the Eyes of a Fourteen-Year-Old - Royal Chukwudumebi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life through the Eyes of a Fourteen-Year-Old&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of poetry written by award-winning teen poet, Royal Chukwudumebi, offering her insights about living life well. She incorporates inspirational thoughts and wisdom for successful everyday living and she focuses on both the beauty and the splendor of lifes challenges and explores the emotional implications of failure. Royal has written over one hundred poems that examine real life events and the emotions that are an integral part of growing up. Both beautiful and inspirational, she writes knowingly about true love and friendship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most Popular&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rain steadily poured down;&lt;br&gt;
His friends soon left and scattered away.&lt;br&gt;
He was alone without a sound;&lt;br&gt;
He stood surrounded the very next day.&lt;br&gt;
Most Popular is an outcast&lt;br&gt;
Who laughs with his so-called friends,&lt;br&gt;
But the facade never lasts.&lt;br&gt;
He wishes it all would fade to an end&lt;br&gt;
And time could then rewind.&lt;br&gt;
Dont judge, for you have wanted that bind.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
