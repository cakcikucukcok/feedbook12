  <title>Revelations of a Hood Chick - Kijana LeTasha Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is an expression of ones perception of their lifes experiences. Sometimes in life we have battles within ourselves. When we are growing and maturing, it can sometimes be painful. But growing pains are normal. We as young children experience the aches in our bones and muscles as we grow. Well, as adults, we experience that same kind of pain, but its in our hearts and minds. The big picture is to embrace our pains because theyre temporary. Once we have reached our maturity, we have an unfiltered wisdom. That is something only experience can bring. The harder we struggle, the stronger we have a chance to become. The choice is our own. In my life, I have struggled with love. Its easy for me to give yet hard to receive. Therefore, I have set out to conquer my inner self. I have started my journey by loving me and letting me love me back. I express my thoughts that are nontraditional because Im not traditional. I have always been considered different or an outcast, but I learned I am supposed to be. These poems are a reflection of who only God can see, and I am ready to reveal myself." />
