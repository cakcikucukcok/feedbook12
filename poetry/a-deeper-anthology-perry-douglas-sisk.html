  <title>A Deeper Anthology - Perry Douglas Sisk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now residing in texas, where i have built my home and live
alone , and am a 28 yr survivor of HIV, derived from a
blood transfusion while active duty military via oral surgery done
in 1983. I now devote my retirement to my preoccupations of
fishing and puttering around my modest home,,along with writting
songs and poems which i have done for 35 plus years, as a singular
vocation.
I feel that in all of us as spirited beings ,we each do hold potential
for compassion some more than others perhaps but still inherant to
us all,,,I write poetry to convey those instincts to those that are less
aware but require reminders that they too are beings of empathy
I trust that my works will offer some a peace of mind and awareness
so needed in this fast paced all too short existance we all share and
to some degree will offer solice in reading words that instill hope
for a better tomorrow, gleened from living, this is my short legacy i
wish to leave." />
