      <meta name="description" content="There are some things or feelings in our lives, what we are ashamed of and really want to hide from that world what surrounds us. But time goes by, those feelings become bigger and bigger that we cant keep them anymore only to ourselves. We feel if we do not let them out, we are going to explode. And someday, we will find ourselves in that moment when we wont care anymore what other people think and wont care what those peoples opinions will cost us. We just starting letting it all out to that world, and it feels good. We feel freedom because now there is nothing to hide, and we accept ourselves such as we are.
In my book, I am sharing my feelings about my past, my failings in different things in my life, and also about my sexuality while I went to Kingdom Hall of Jehovah Witnesses." />
