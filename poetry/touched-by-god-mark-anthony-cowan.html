  <title>Touched by God - Mark Anthony Cowan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Touched by God is an eclectic collection of soul-searching and motivational poems inspired by the Holy Spirit. It has several chapters, each with its compilation of germane poems to uplift, challenge, and bless. 
Poems on prayer prepare the way, allowing faith to usher in the promise of Gods Word timely fulfilled. You will become cognizant of the love of God as it emanates from the very pages. Your faith will be taken to new heights as you engage the poems on faith and courage. The way of the Word and obedience will reinforce the foundational importance of the Gods Word in our lives. 
In a world of increasing perplexities, this book offers hope to a people who will direct their minds to be in touch with God. The rallying call to all in such times is epitomized in the scripture Psalm 94:14, For the Lord will not cast off His people, nor will He forsake His inheritance. 
Touched by God is a light that shines in a gloomy world spiraling out of control. It enables man to know that there is a blessed hope available. The only real hope man can embrace is through contact with the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God, who alone knows the heart of man and the issues that spring forth. There is no better place to be than to be drawing ever, being in touch with him.
The words contained in the book come with no bias to those who are already in touch with God or to those yet to know God the creator. The spirit-filled messages will enrich the lives of allmans soul no longer disquieted, the peace of God assuming control. Read with an open mind and allow yourself to be touched by God." />
