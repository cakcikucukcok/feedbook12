  <title>2014 Falcon&#39;s Anthology - Benjamin Franklin Middle School Students</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Anthology was a dream. We proved that the theory of Team Work works. Our outstanding school community (parents, teachers, staff, community, administrators and students) made this Anthology come true! Thanks to I-Universe Publishing Co. for making our Anthology a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a true believer that every student has the capacity to excellence. We, as educators, are instruments to expose them to all types of learning experiences. Like John Dewey said, we learn by doing. The empowerment and self-confidence that each one of our students obtained through the planning-researching-creating-writing-editing-sharing-presenting to the community of their original written work, has been a marvelous experience, invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you and your family enjoy our 1st Falcons Anthology. From whatever forum you are, please continue supporting our youth in to learning to manage and develop all their strengths toward a successful future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to convey our eagerness about writing, you can do the same thing! With your colleagues, students, family, between friends. Dance with words ... start writing today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more information about this project or others, please email at rbadia@dallasisd.org&lt;/p&gt;
