  <title>Writings from the Spirit - Peter Benjamin LeBuhn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Writings from the Spirit&lt;/i&gt; offers a poetry collection focused on the spirituality of life. Author Peter Benjamin LeBuhn inspires through lovingly crafted verse that offers the hope and optimism of the lifes spiritual side. Reviewing a spiritual journey of ten years, LeBuhn explores times of great loss and those times of great faith and renewal. These verses are based upon true, honest feelings and emotions that will touch the heart and inspire the spirit. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Journey
Beleaguered and Beaten
Burned to a crisp
My faith I have lost
What is to become of this?
The Fire burns brightly  The ashes spread widely.
All I feel is death
Lord how do I get out of this?
The light flickers only dim
But flicker it does
For The answer now is known
I have lost everything only to regain it
Trials and toils
They do boil in the deep of my soul
My burning and yearning to do right
With all thy might
I humble thyself in thy sight
The journey has been long  now I am strong&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Peters words live; as I read them I feel the meaning of the poem or song come alive. He really knows how to capture the here and now. 
Carol Lee, artist 
Peters poetry is truly romantic; I can see myself within the words. 
Suzan Gumush, poet, Kent, United Kingdom
Peters words are very inspiringbeautiful choice of words, beautiful imagery; many of the poems are like  sagas. A paintbrush of words. 
Keiah Delu, author
&quot;Peter&#39;s use of words is truly touching,great word use, passionate ,emotional, the words come to life.&quot; 
Claire Jones, poet 
I have enjoyed reading passages from your book many nights. You did write as though it is happening now. That was so clever of you! I have read some to friends and they too conquer that you are very gifted and a romantic.
