  <title>Ministering to Your Soul - Evangelist Patricia Kinard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ministering to Your Soul&lt;/i&gt; presents Patricia Kinards first collection of poetry. She has heard the still, small voice of God encouraging her to share her thoughts in poetry to glorify God. In response to that voice, she offers these verses that come from deep within her soul, written to minister to others by inspiring their goals, enriching their faith, and encouraging a desire to follow through. Gods unconditional love for each of us lights the way to our faith in Him, and Kinards poems seek to open the way to that love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ministering to Your Soul&lt;/i&gt; provides an inspiring collection of poems given to Kinard by God to light the path to His love and righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Faith&lt;/p&gt;
Father thank you for blessing us with eyes into a hope thats certain,&lt;/br&gt;
devoting our hearts and minds into a future thats not foreseen,&lt;/br&gt;
but giving us attitudes of beliefs in our visions and dreams into valuable purposes,&lt;/br&gt;
disciplining all things intended to manifest supernatural powers and miracles to follow,&lt;/br&gt;
if through trust and faith we believe all things are perceivable, attainable,&lt;/br&gt;
devisable and we can call them into being,&lt;/br&gt;
knowing hope is faith into the unseen,&lt;/br&gt;
but it takes a heart of patience to redeem.&lt;/center&gt;" />
