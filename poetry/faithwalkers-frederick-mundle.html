  <title>Faithwalkers - Frederick Mundle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faithwalkers comprises a collection of poems addressing those desirous of walking in faith. Long ago, the one who became the father of faith defi ned the Faithwalker and set the bar for all of those who would subsequently lay claim to having faith. A poem about him lies
within. Faithwalkers appeals to a wide audience of inter-denominational people of faith who may or may not be at the top of their respective walks or ministries in Christ as yet. For those uncertain in their current walks, the inherent hope is to awaken them. For the verage Faithwalker (find out if you are a person of faith) the hope is to stimulate them to go on to greater heights in their faith. For those of invincible faith, those who walk at the apex of their ministries, the hope is to encourage them in their daily challenges. Any given poem may have the anointing of the Holy Spirit to be the prompter to uplift the Faithwalker in general. For those who do not have a faith, or those who may be weak or burnt out in their faith, the greatest hope of all is to ignite them once again. Finally, for any without faith, Faithwalkers will offer a call to become a Faithwalker." />
