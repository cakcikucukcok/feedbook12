  <title>Living Poetry with Dynasty Hill - Dynasty Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living Poetry with Dynasty Hill is a phenomenal collection of poetry at random by the author as she lives day by day. The author gives the reader more than a collective piece in organized fashion, but she writes by inspiration day to day about random topics that come to play. Living Poetry with Dynasty Hill is a reality of real talent as well as everyday thoughts, fears, and challenges that may come to challenge hearts every day. Dynasty chose to keep this artistic read interesting in what is next and demonstrates raw emotion in poetry that helps connect her audience to their emotion and evoke change, healing, restoration, and peace. She chose to keep in a random fashion read to keep the reader interested in what is next, as well as to demonstrate raw skill that is needed in poetry that helps people put their words to their emotions and hopefully create a positive outcome to reality as to evoke change. Dynasty is known to write and speak by creative vision and inspiration, and this is clearly seen in the topic that inspired and ignited her heart. Life now is ever changing from one moment to the next, with happiness to the next sadness, life to death at the blink of the eye; therefore the title takes meaning as she writes living poetry with Dynasty Hill. Life sends setbacks and forward comebacks shifts and turns, and she wanted to connect with readers by writing a book that does not organize poetry by categories but help the reader as life happens. Dynasty Hill pieces not only intrigue on whats next but engages the reader to fulfill engagement by pieces from helping so many understand what poetry really is and how it helps humans heal. She navigates the reader with pieces from love, dating a man that is not right, and life and death to self-esteem topics that motivate. She even includes pieces that help all gender male and female and teen to adolescents. Its a must read again book. She even gives parents a poem to read to their children. She does not leave no one out. It is especially meant to inspire and ignite zeal and zest in this life to make good grades to helping dating and married couples. She always will be a Christian writer and by right, a poet. Dynasty was in the Mega Festival of Poets in 2017, and her signature poem Let Your Doves Fly could be heard with beauty as she demonstrates her words with two doves. Dynasty Hill is known for how she captures the heart of people with words of inspirations, evolving thought, evoking change, and proving to a dark world that words heal and bring peace and hope. She takes the reader to lessons of wisdom and also success and how to come to know the Lord as saviour." />
