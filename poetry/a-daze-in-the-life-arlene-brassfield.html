  <title>A Daze in the Life - Arlene Brassfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is made up of mostly poems and also short stories and sayings. This book is a testimony of my life. I am sixty nine years old. My life has been years of bondage, hurts, burtialities and misjudgements, as well as rape and mind control, through the misappropriate efforts of my stepfather and my natural mother. I am not asking for sympathy, for I have made it thus far through the blessings of God and people around me such as my son, daughter-in-law, my two sisters and my brother and others who have stood by me in faith and helped me to over come up to this point. My book walks along my life in telling the story as well as showing that through it all there were days of sunshine, and days when I could smile. Maybe this book will help you in times, when you need encouragement, and to know, that with trust, and belief in God, you too, can make it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Thank you for your support.
