  <title>In Search of the Lost Volume 2 - Jeffrey Eugene Elliott, Emily Jane Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the publication of the first volume of In Search of the Lost, Volume Two, still the poems in this work are a humble attempt to explore our human search for meaning and purpose. We hope you enjoy the poems in Volume Two. We believe both works should be explored together.
Included in the Second Volume of In Search of the Lost, by Emily Jane Elliott and Jeffrey Eugene Elliott are four poems originally included in the First Volume of In Search of the Lost. The four poems from the first volume also included in this volume are, Streets of Fire, Gauisus Dia, Heaven Descends to Dwell, Amelia and Memories. Additionally, the poem, Search was added upon from the version found in Volume One. We hope that you enjoy Volume Two as much as readers indicated they enjoyed Volume One. This poetry is dedicated to Owen, Ryder, Matthew and Trace with great love and pride." />
