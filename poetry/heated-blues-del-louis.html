  <title>Heated Blues - Del Louis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Heated Blues&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of poetry that examines longing, loss, love, and the disillusionment of knowing were all running out of time. Our souls are searching for the truth and the reality of lifeboth our lives and those of others. The poems examine the isolation that comes when we face our own mortality. We fervently hope to somehow transcend time and extend our humanity without realizing how that is even possible. In this insightful collection of verse, author Del Louis has delved into the rhythms that help us to deal with our humanity, change, adversity, and everything else inside ourselves.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Falling&lt;/b&gt;
Where I stand today
Its as if Im kneeling
Like a raindrop
Dispersed
Falling, landed
That cant repel the object it struck
Or the crusader
Invading time or our minds
That I loosely scrap together
Like feathers to dead art projects
All innovation finished
Like a last kiss
As if we moved on from being a sorted
Possession
Just rubbish under a truss
The homeless mightve more dignity
In a swill from the back of a commode
Holding a dripping candle
Purifying rough skin when its touch cools
Dropped to my knees again
As if I were your fallen angel
Needled by Gods unspoken words&lt;/i&gt;" />
