  <title>Be Poet . . . Be! - Raymond A. Hiraldo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are times when we all feel so emotionally vulnerable that, all we can do is look towards the sky for any possible answers in the forms of celestial signs. Some of us shrug things off when nothing is shown to us but, many of us continue crying out to the sky asking even more questions. I admit at being among the many people who have done that very same thing. As I was so busy looking everywhere for a sign, I failed to look within my very being. Once I surrendered all my emotions to everything that is me is when one answer came. It not only came as a voice but, it even appeared almost as like a constellation in the sky. A sky I have looked up to with questions for so long. 
The answer? It was, Instead of wasting time questioning yourself as to how?, why?, or what? you are, you should just use that time to be!" />
