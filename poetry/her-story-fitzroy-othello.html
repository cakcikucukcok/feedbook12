  <title>Her Story - Fitzroy Othello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the first to the final stanza Her Story is an exhibition of the power of the written word. Its poems are highly conversational in style and explore the realities confronted by a broad spectrum of human society. It also paints a pleasing mosaic of humanity as a whole as the poetic voice highlights a wide yet compelling range of themes common to mankind as a composite whole.
In lines that are attractive in form yet tight in structure and thematic development the poet, Fitzroy Othello Jr, boldly addresses issues such as sex and sexuality, abuse in the home and society as well as making a poignant examination of human history.
Each poem flows appealingly to the eye and is yet as inescapably poetic as the tide of the Caribbean sea is to the islands whose shores she bathes in beauty. Take the time now to wade through the compelling free verse of Her Story!" />
