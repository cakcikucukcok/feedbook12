  <title>Weaving Wonder Webs - John Haughton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Poetic Anthology by John Haughton
John studied Philosophy and Theology at the Redemptorist College, (CSSR.) Cluain Mhuire, Galway, Ireland, majored in Sociology and Town Planning at University College Dublin followed by a practical Horticultural course at the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin. Deep Ecology now underpins his thought processes, work and philosophy.  John co-founded Forest Friends Ireland presents his own environmental radio programme, ENVIRO, on local Dublin Community Radio station, NEAR 90.3 FM, www.nearfm.ie.  John maintains that to be creative is the most important thing in life and that earth connectedness though a primordial instinct needs nevertheless to be rediscovered and reaffirmed on a daily basis.  Johns poems are environmental in nature, with deep ecological undertones.  He agrees with writer Baron Wormser who said that Poetry is a spirit gift we give to people. John is author of the Silver Lining which is the story of the Irish pioneering Aviatrix lady Heath and the birth of Irish aviation in the 1930s. He is editor of two anthologies of poetry written by pupils of Ballyfermot Primary Schools in Dublin, entitled The Forest of Children Dreaming. Some of Johns poems are included in anthologies of the Bayside Writers Migrating Minds series, and in Trinity Collage a publication of the Trinity Writers group. He was joint editor of the Cirde Na Coille poetry anthology, Seeing the Wood and the Trees.  His extended poem Beslan-Not Forgotten is now available to purchase." />
