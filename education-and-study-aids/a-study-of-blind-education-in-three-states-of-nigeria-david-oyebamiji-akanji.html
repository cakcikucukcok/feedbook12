      <meta name="description" content="Despite policies to provide equal education opportunities for African children, the dreams of most disabled students are not realized, especially for blind children. Many blind students do not have an opportunity to continue their education.

Researched as part of a doctoral dissertation, this study assessed the:
Quality and effectiveness of practices governing the management of blind education in self-contained schools
Quality and effectiveness of policies and practices governing the inclusion of blind and visually impaired students in the regular classrooms of mainstream schools
Unique nature of the problems hampering the academic performance of blind and visually impaired students in three most populous state capitals in Nigeria 
Obstacles associated with self-concept of blind and visually impaired students 
Oyebamiji Akanji shares his research strategy, results, and recommendations. He reveals that the management of blind education in Nigeria public schools requires adequate policies, proper education for teachers, availability of appropriate educational resources, and collaboration among general and special education teachers." />
