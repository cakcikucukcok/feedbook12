  <title>The Writing on the Classroom Wall: How Posting Your Most Passionate Beliefs About Education Can Empower Your Students, Propel Your Growth,  and Lead t - Steve Wyborney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;22 Teachers, 22 Learners.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Steve Wyborney&amp;#39;s classroom, everyone is a teacher and a learner. That may be true in your classroom as well, but do your students know you are ready to learn right alongside them? &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s a simple idea, but one that when publicly shared on his classroom&amp;#39;s wall significantly influenced the way Steve approached teaching - and the willingness of his students to risk expressing novel ideas. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In The Writing on the Classroom Wall, Steve explains how posting and discussing Big Ideas can lead to deeper learning. &amp;nbsp;From this book, you&amp;#39;ll learn why: sharing your ideas will sharpen and refine them. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;#39;s okay if some of your ideas fall off the wall. &amp;nbsp;The Big Ideas you share don&amp;#39;t have to be profound to make a profound impact on learning. &amp;nbsp;If you look around your classroom, you will see it: a blank space on your wall that is waiting for you to post your deepest, most passionate beliefs about learning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Will you share your Big Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;" />
