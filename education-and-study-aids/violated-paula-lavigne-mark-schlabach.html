It condemned any sex outside of marriage, and drinking alcohol was grounds for dismissal. Students weren&#39;t even allowed to dance on campus until 1996.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the last several years, however, Baylor officials were hiding a dark secret: Female students were being sexually assaulted at an alarming rate. Baylor administrators did very little to help victims, and their assailants rarely faced discipline for their abhorrent behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, after a pair of high-profile criminal cases involving football players, an independent examination of Baylor&#39;s handling of allegations of sexual assault led to sweeping changes, including the unprecedented ouster of its president, athletics director, and popular, highly successful football coach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For several years, campuses and sports teams across the country have been plagued with accusations of sexual violence, and they&#39;ve been criticized for how they responded to the students involved. But Baylor stands out. A culture reigned in which people believed that any type of sex, especially violent non-consensual sex, simply &quot;doesn&#39;t happen here.&quot; Yet it was happening. Many people within Baylor&#39;s leadership knew about it. And they chose not to act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Paula Lavigne and Mark Schlabach weave together the complex - and at times contradictory - narrative of how a university and football program ascending in national prominence came crashing down amidst the stories of woman after woman coming forward describing their assaults, and a university system they found indifferent to their pain.&lt;/div&gt;" />
