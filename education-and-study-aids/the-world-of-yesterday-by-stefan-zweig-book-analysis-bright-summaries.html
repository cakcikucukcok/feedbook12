Zweig grew up in a middle-class Jewish family in Vienna at a time when the city was at the heart of a vast centuries-old empire and the cultural and artistic capital of the continent.

Mounting anti-Semitism in Europe and the worsening of the Second World War led him to flee to Brazil with his wife, where they both committed suicide in 1942. He left behind a vast and influential body of work, comprising novels, novellas, essays, plays, biographies and poetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;The World of Yesterday&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
