  <title>Prescription Medication/Drug Misuse Andabuse: a Clear &amp; Present Danger - Dr. James A. Mays</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James A. Mays is a true renaissance man: poet, scholar,
popular novelist, songwriter, cardiologist, and civil leader. His
individual achievements are such that he was the recipient
of the George Washington Medal. Other notable recipients of
this prestigious award are Barbara Jordan and the late Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
Dr. Mays has written several songs, one of which, Happy Birthday
Mama, was recorded by Bill Cosby. He also co-wrote several
songs with H.B Barnum.
As an author he is responsible for nine novels, including his latest
Trapped, which is in preparation to become a movie. An earlier
trilogy, Strivers, is being developed as a miniseries.
Dr. Mays is widely recognized as the founder of community
problem-solving programs such as the Adopt-A-Family
endowment. He is currently involved in several campaigns
promoting drug and AIDS awareness and giving assistance to
the homeless.
He has frequently appeared on television, featuring on shows
including The Today Show, The Phil Donahue Show, on radio,
such as the Voice of America and has had articles published in LIFE,
Newsweek, the Washington Post, the L.A. Times, and Ebony.
Dr. Mays, who was decorated as combat physician in Vietnam, is
a lone parent with four sons." />
