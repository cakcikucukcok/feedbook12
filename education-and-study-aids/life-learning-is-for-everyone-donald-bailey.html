  <title>Life Learning Is for Everyone - Donald Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in disability, in education, in helping broaden the horizon of opportunities for young people exiting special education will be the wiser for having read this book. Readable, fast-paced, well written, and instructivethis book provides fascinating and important insight into the brilliant leadership, hard work, and innovative education program development of one individual . . . Donald Bailey&lt;br&gt;
Madeleine Will&lt;br&gt;
Vice President of Public Policy&lt;br&gt;
National Down Syndrome Society&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Donald Bailey demonstrates the power parents have to create new and better options for their children with intellectual disabilities and makes it clear that the first step in his journey was listening to his sons dreams and believing that they were possible. In recounting his personal journey of hope, disappointment, and ultimately success, Donald demonstrates that all parents have the power to make change happen. I hope that every person, parent, teacher, and policymaker who reads this book sees in it a reflection of their own potential to make the dream of college into reality. These efforts will pay dividends for years to come for families of students with intellectual disabilities in South Carolina and throughout our country. &lt;br&gt;
Meg Grigal, PhD&lt;br&gt;
Co-Director, Think College&lt;br&gt;
Institute for Community Inclusion&lt;br&gt;
UMASS-Boston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This book will inform and empower any American who cares about ensuring that young adults with intellectual disabilities get the postsecondary experiences they deserve to realize their potential. The process that occurred in South Carolina provides a viable blueprint to provide postsecondary options for any young person who is intellectually challenged, regardless of where they live. &lt;br&gt;
Jim Rex, PhD&lt;br&gt;
Former South Carolina State Superintendent of Education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is a must-read story of a family with an unwavering devotion to the education of their son. It seems as though every parent I talk to feels as if they are the only one on this educational journey. With a real-life happy ending, this book provides insight into one familys educational journey and the impact that the journey will have on generations to come for students with disabilities. &lt;br&gt;
