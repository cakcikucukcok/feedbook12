  <title>Man Driven Brain Evolution The Road to New Intelligent Life Forms - Lavirrealista</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Artificial Intelligence is now the focus of massive technological efforts around the world and an AI race seems to be on between the major powers.&amp;nbsp; Machines are currently able to recognise patterns (voices, faces, words) but so far have been unable to &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; and reason.&amp;nbsp; The rapid increase in computing power will change that.&amp;nbsp; The question then is, how will people live and interact with man made sentient beings? That is a big enough question, but suppose in a parallel development, people accept mind and body implants greatly to enhance cognitive and physical abilities? What are the implications for individuals, society and the planet?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While this mad technological rush gathers pace only a few people are stopping to really think through the consequences which has never happened in the past when new technology arises, but for AI it is very necessary.&amp;nbsp; To understand why, this essay explores some of the current thinking from the point of view of science fiction the best of which takes technology to its logical conclusions and allow us to view many sided versions of the future." />
