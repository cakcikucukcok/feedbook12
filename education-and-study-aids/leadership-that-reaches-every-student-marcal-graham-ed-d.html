  <title>Leadership That Reaches Every Student - Marcal Graham Ed.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All too many students enter and eventually graduate school ill-equipped for academic, professional, and personal success.

Thinking critically and honing decision-making skills
Developing personal accountability
Rising above &quot;anti-leaders&quot; and building healthy relationships

&lt;I&gt;Leadership That Reaches Every Student&lt;/I&gt; will not only help individual students to continually strive for-and consistently achieve-academic and personal excellence, but it will also aid communities in making great strides toward closing the achievement gap plaguing schools today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
