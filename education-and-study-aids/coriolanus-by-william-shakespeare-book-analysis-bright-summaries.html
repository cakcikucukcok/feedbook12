  <title>Coriolanus by William Shakespeare (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;Coriolanus &lt;/i&gt;with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;Coriolanus&lt;/i&gt; by William Shakespeare, a historical play set in the Roman Republic. The play centres on the titular character of Coriolanus, a well-respected general whose pride in his own military genius and aristocratic background has fostered in him a deep disdain for the common people. This pride leads to his downfall: when Coriolanus launches into an ill-considered tirade against the plebeians while running for consul, the crowd turns violently against him and he is exiled from Rome. Hell-bent on revenge, Coriolanus forms a temporary alliance with his former nemesis, the Volscian general Aufidius, and turns the full might of his fury towards the city he once called home. &lt;i&gt;Coriolanus &lt;/i&gt;is a lesser-known play by William Shakespeare, who is widely considered to be one of the most influential writers in the history of the English language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;Coriolanus&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
