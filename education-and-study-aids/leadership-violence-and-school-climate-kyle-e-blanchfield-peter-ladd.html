  <title>Leadership, Violence, and School Climate - Kyle E. Blanchfield, Peter Ladd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the book, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Leadership, Violence and School Climate: Case Studies in Creating Non-Violent Schools, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;three important themes are emphasized namely, democratic leadership, violence and school climate. The book recognizes that safety should be the first issue of concern when addressing school violence. However, violence in schools should not be the sole concern of outside experts who advocate for lock downs, metal detectors and bullet proof glass. Through democratic school leadership violence can be reduced by those professionals actually working in schools. The book emphasizes that reduction in school violence originates from school leaders having a comprehensive understanding of the climate found in schools. Leadership, violence and school climate are connected through the use of democratic principles that address; crisis, trauma, empowerment, common ground, critical thinking, assertiveness and others. The book points out how schools can reverse their reactionary stance to violence, and become pro-active through the practice of democratic principles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
