  <title>Global Education Reform - Joseph O. Esin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global Education Reform&lt;/i&gt; presents an opportunity to reorganize, transform, and recapture misplaced human potential. The book advocates a new culture of the education process through the establishment of Student Concerned Review Councils (SCRCs) as a vehicle for global education reform in college and university communities. The proposed SCRC must be viewed as an active search engine for a global conduit to encourage chancellors, vice chancellors, presidents, professors, and ministers of education to be fully integrated in the SCRC process. The book notes that effective design and implementation of Information Technology Resource Service Centers (ITRSCs) on college and university campuses will definitely help students to reconnect with their lost potential, elevate their self-confidence, improve their inner satisfaction, develop their personal life and professional career, and restore dignity to the education community. The implementation of Information Technology Resource Service Centers (ITRSC), Programming Resource Technology Center (PTRC), Open Access Technology Resource Center (OATRC), Professional Development Technology Center (PDTC), Professional Development Technology Center (PDTC), Academic Faculty Resource Technology Center (AFRTC), Academic Research Technology Center (ARTC), Learning Resource Technology Center (LRTC), and Certification Resource Technology Center (CRTC) will enhance the understanding, importance, and advantages of information technology in the education process.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The author sees the decay of the Nigerian educational system as a regrettable oversight and a deterrent to global education reform and the preparation, nurturing and education of future education leaders of the unified free world. The author asserts that Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Sir Tafawa Balewa, General Aguiyi Ironsi, General Yakubu Gowon, Chief Obafemi Owolowo, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Brigadier Udoakaha Esuene, and Governor Owelle Okorocha were patriotic, enduring, and outstanding education advocates for all citizens in Nigeria. A lifelong education is an instructive and enlightening route to wisdom, intellectual growth, and maturity; therefore, it is the authors assertion that combined and collaborative efforts are needed, as well as support from ministers of education and other politicians who are willing to allocate adequate financial resources that will enable privileged elites; chancellors, vice chancellors, presidents, professors to prepare future leaders of the education system in their formative years to establish an attitude of persistence, and self-confidence to cope with the demanding workforce and professional challenges of todays information technology society. The author submits that effective and efficient use of information technology as valuable data and voice transmission tools, e-mail, cell phones, Internet access as education instruction delivery apparatus, and communication system for global language barriers will definitely create a singular and mutually sovereign system for the successful development of global education reform.&lt;/p&gt;" />
