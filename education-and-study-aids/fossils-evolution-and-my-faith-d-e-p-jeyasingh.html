  <title>Fossils, Evolution and My Faith - D.E.P. Jeyasingh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evolution is an important concept in Biology. Textbooks on this subject list a number of evidences for organic evolution. One such evidence is what comes from the study of Fossils. In Part I of the book, in chapters 1 to 3, a definition for fossils is put forth and the methods of their study are briefly outlined, thereby introducing the reader to Paleontology, the science of fossil study, Chapters 4 to 7 in Part II of the book, give an exposition of the Thoughts, Observations, Concepts and Theories pertaining to Organic Evolution, the subject matter of Part II in general. These initial chapters are intended to lead the reader to a better understanding of the Fossil Evidences for Evolution among the various groups of organisms, including man, dealt with in the remaining chatters of this part, beginning with the Protists in chapter 8. Volume One terminates at this point, leaving the remaining 11 chapters of Part II to be covered in Volume Two that would also contain Part III on my Faith." />
