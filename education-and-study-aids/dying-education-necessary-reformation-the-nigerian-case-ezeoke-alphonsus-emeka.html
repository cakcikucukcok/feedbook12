  <title>Dying Education: Necessary Reformation. the Nigerian Case - Ezeoke, Alphonsus Emeka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is an educational piece and a thoroughly researched contribution in the 21st century Nigeria. I recommend it to all lovers of education. The Education Ministers, Boards and other relevant bodies have to read this. University Dons would find Very Rev. Fr. Dr. Alphonsus Ezeokes book exceptionally useful. It is a handbook for todays students.&lt;br /&gt;-Very Rev. Msgr. Prof. J.P.C. Nzomiwu&lt;br /&gt;(Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straddling two cultures, Fr. Ezeoke not only exposes the urgent need for educational reform in Nigeria, but he also advances the strategies that are needed to reach under the current system and lift it up. Knowing the historicity, Fr. Ezeokes careful assessment calls for action and boldly determines that such an undertaking is key to Nigerian growth, unity and global interaction.&lt;br /&gt;-Cathy B. Grandjean, MA BCC&lt;br /&gt;(Fmr) Director of Chaplaincy, Catholic Health Services of Long Island&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write to congratulate Rev. Dr. Alphonsus Ezeoke for this unique 21st Century contribution to the field of education. While he promoted positive and optimistic concern to educational growth in general, he equally got to the root of the dilemma, illusions, presumptions, ideologies and projections that impact negatively on its attainment. I highly recommend this masterpiece to the educational system in Nigeria, especially to everyone who is conscious to make his/her educational journey a success story.&lt;br /&gt;-Anthony O. Nwachukwu, PhD, Psy.D&lt;br /&gt;(Prof. of Counseling Psychology and West African Studies)&lt;br /&gt;Chair, PhD Defense Panel, NY&lt;/p&gt;" />
