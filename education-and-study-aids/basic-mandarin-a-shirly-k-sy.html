  <title>Basic Mandarin A - Shirly K. Sy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Comments from authors students 
Kiveli Venz Paneda 
The textbook was very helpful &amp; student/user-friendly. It can be easily appreciated by those who opt for self-studying whether they have or lack any previous knowledge and/or experience in speaking Chinese (Mandarin). However, it is better understood when with the guidance of a teacher.The concepts &amp; the basics were discussed thoroughly &amp; therefore establishes a good foundation for those who want to learn 
the language. 
Harold Diokno 
Basic Mandarin A is a very useful tool for studying Hanyu. Not only does it provide realistic and simplified lessons, it also gives the students a smooth and navigable approach to learning a rather complicated language, through its exercises, vocabulary and supplementary notes. There are relatable and situational examples after every lesson, not to mention the updated and easy-to-learn drills on Chinese characters." />
