      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following the publication of &lt;i&gt;Building Leadership Capacity in Schools&lt;/i&gt; in 1998, Linda Lambert visited educators around the world to see how they had applied the ideas presented in her book to their schools and districts. Though everyone she spoke with agreed on the importance of high leadership capacity, they also had many questions about how best to achieve this goal. &lt;i&gt;Leadership Capacity for Lasting School Improvement&lt;/i&gt; is the author&#39;s attempt to answer those questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book begins by outlining the five major prerequisites for high leadership capacity: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Skillful participation in the work of leadership&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Inquiry-based use of data to inform decisions and practice&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Broad involvement and collective responsibility for student learning&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Reflective practice that leads to innovation&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*High or steadily improving student achievement&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of steps schools should take to meet these criteria, Lambert quotes at length from her discussions with educators to provide a view of leadership enhancement techniques in practice. She also includes helpful rubrics and surveys that teachers and administrators alike can use to personally assess their leadership skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the author&#39;s own insights with real-life examples and practical exercises, &lt;i&gt;Leadership Capacity for Lasting School Improvement&lt;/i&gt; is an indispensable guide to enhancing and sustaining a culture of leadership in any school.&lt;/p&gt;" />
