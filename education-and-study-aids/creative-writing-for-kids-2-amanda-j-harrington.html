  <title>Creative Writing for Kids 2 - Amanda J Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All too often, children are put off creative writing by feeling they have to do it right. Creativity comes in lots of different packages, and not just the ones marked with a red tick or a gold star!
This book comes from original exercises and activities created especially for one-to-one lessons, creative writing groups, school visits and for home educated children. The focus is on fun and creative thinking, so that literacy and writing skills happen more naturally, without it feeling like work.
The age range for all the books in the Creative Writing for Kids range is 7-14, depending on ability. Lots of exercises can be expanded to suit keen writers and adapted for reluctant learners and special needs students." />
