  <title>Hello! My Name Is Public School, and I Have an Image Problem - Leslie Milder, Jane Braddock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So much energy is focused on whats wrong with our public schools and how to fix them that we often lose sight of the extraordinary work occurring in our schools every day, thanks to millions of caring, dedicated professional educators who work hard to ensure every student reaches their potential. 
In Hello! My Name is Public School and I Have an Image Problem, authors and teachers Leslie Milder and Jane Braddock provide a solution for educators who wish to strengthen public confidence in their public schools. They share commonsense techniques on how schools and their employees can establish themselves as ambassadors who convey a positive message. This book enunciates a step-by-step approach to challenging the unjust criticism and accusations of failure by directing the energies of those who work in our schools to step up as ambassadors for Americas public schools and the children they serve.
The authors underscore the power of professional unity and its profoundly positive impact on the profession, and why a culture of brotherhood is an essential element of any successful organization. The forces that weaken public trust and confidence in public education are discussed at length, as well as strategies for restoring public pride, hope, optimism, and confidence in our public schools and in those who dedicate their lives to educating our youth." />
