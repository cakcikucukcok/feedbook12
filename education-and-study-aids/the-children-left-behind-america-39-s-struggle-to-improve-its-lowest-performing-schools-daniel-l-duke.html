  <title>The Children Left Behind: America&#39;s Struggle to Improve Its Lowest Performing Schools - Daniel L. Duke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.079167&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Between 2002 and 2016, the federal government, state governments, and school districts undertook unprecedented measures to improve the lowest-performing schools. This book draws on dozens of actual examples to illustrate the wide range of interventions adopted over this time period. Among the initiatives examined in depth are efforts by states to provide technical assistance to schools and districts, offer students educational choices, engage communities in school improvement, take over low-performing schools and districts, create special state-run school districts, and close failing schools. Also discussed are district-initiated measures, including programs to standardize instruction, innovative approaches to raising student achievement, and restructuring of district operations. The book concludes with an assessment of 15 years of turnaround initiatives and recommendations based on lessons learned over this time period.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
