  <title>Further Adventures of Timothy in Colonial New South Wales - G. Beckett, L. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Timothy has enjoyed his school years in the first town in the new colony of New South Wales. Since he came from England he has watched the town of Sydney grow and has seen how the convicts have built many substantial buildings. In the first story of this book Tim considers a number of activities, in and around Sydney, that the convicts have been involved in, that have made a substantial difference in this settlement.
During Tim&#39;s time in New South Wales he has witnessed the crossing of the rugged Blue Mountains by Europeans and a road being built that has made a significant difference in opening up land to the West of these mountains. Tim is keen to do his own &#39;exploring&#39; in these mountains and in the second story he sets out on  his own trip across this rugged terrain.
Illustrations from early European days in Australia provide the reader with added insight into these times." />
