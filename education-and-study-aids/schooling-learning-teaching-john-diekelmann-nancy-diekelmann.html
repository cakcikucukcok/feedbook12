  <title>Schooling Learning Teaching - John Diekelmann, Nancy Diekelmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Schooling Learning Teaching: Toward Narrative Pedagogy calls forth ways of thinking the issues of schooling, learning, and teaching. The task of this book is to plumb this triad as a phenomenological relationship that emerges as an intra rather than an inter. Do conventional pedagogies favor preparing nursing students for a healthcare system that no longer exists? Has competency-based nursing education reached its completion? Exhausted its possibilities? Converging conversations and Concernful Practices of Schooling Learning Teaching show themselves as the telling of narratives. Narrative Pedagogy gathers all pedagogies?past, extant, and future?into converging conversations by rethinking schooling, learning, and teaching as an intra-related, co-occurring invisible phenomenon. Relating as telling and listening reveals the richness of situated involvements as they meaningfully disclose and beckon: they simply ask to be listened to.&lt;p&gt; 
NURSING EDUCATION&lt;p&gt; 
This book is a treasure-trove that calls out a voyage of discovery. Narrative Pedagogy is the realization of 20 years of hermeneutic phenomenological research by Nancy Diekelmann. In her scholarship she has attended to the listenings of students, teachers, and clinicians in nursing educational settings in order to move beyond the constrictions inherent in the traditions of schooling?those that pursue the production of students as trained outputs by teachers and clinicians, bound to particular sets of strategies. Narrative Pedagogy is the first nursing pedagogy from nursing research for nursing education. Both our eyes and our ears will be opened to a richer way of thinking.&lt;br&gt;
