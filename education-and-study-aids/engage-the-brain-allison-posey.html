  <title>Engage the Brain - Allison Posey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Research on the brain has shown that emotion plays a key role in learning, but how can educators apply that research in their day-to-day interactions with students? What are some teaching strategies that take advantage of what we know about the brain?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Engage the Brain&lt;/em&gt; answers these questions with easy-to-understand explanations of the brain&#39;s emotion networks and how they affect learning, paired with specific suggestions for classroom strategies that can make a real difference in how and what students learn. Readers will discover how to design an environment for learning that&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes material relevant, relatable, and engaging.
&lt;li&gt;Accommodates tremendous variability in students&#39; brains by giving them multiple options for how to approach their learning.
&lt;li&gt;Incorporates Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and guidelines.
&lt;li&gt;Uses process-oriented feedback and other techniques to spark students&#39; intrinsic motivation.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Allison Posey explains how schools can use the same &quot;emotional brain&quot; concepts to create work environments that reduce professional stress and the all-too-common condition of teacher burnout.
&lt;p&gt;Real-world classroom examples, along with reflection and discussion questions, add to the usefulness of &lt;em&gt;Engage the Brain&lt;/em&gt; as a practical, informative guide for understanding how to capture the brain&#39;s incredible power and achieve better results at all grade levels, in all content areas." />
