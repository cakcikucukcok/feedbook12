  <title>Fail to Plan, Plan to Fail - Darryl Vidal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FAIL TO PLAN, PLAN TO FAIL is a book for Education Technology professionals who understand that Ed Tech projects are complex and costly, and therefore must be planned and managed just like any other large-scale project. Oftentimes Education Technology professionals move straight from naming an initiative, such as &amp;ldquo;1 to 1 computing, or BYOD&amp;rdquo; right into implementation, without taking into consideration the necessary infrastructure, bandwidth and capacity. These requirements may double or even quadruple the overall expenditure. &lt;br /&gt;But in recent decades, with the massive call for classroom technology, the large-scale technology programs that have made the news have been huge failures, and have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars, taking some superintendents with them.&lt;br /&gt;What is the key to avoiding these failures, and how can you insure that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen to your school? The key is planning and project management. Education Technology Strategic Planning is the subject of this book. It provides a detailed process, called MAPIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; that guides the planner through five phases for developing your school&amp;rsquo;s Ed Tech Strategic Plan: Needs Identification, Needs Analysis, Recommendations, Feasibility and Implementation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
