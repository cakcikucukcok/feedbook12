  <title>The Inquirer - Jaclyn Dawn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When an accident jeopardizing the family farm draws Amiah Williams back to Kingsley, Alberta, population 1431, she doesn&#39;t expect her homecoming to make front-page news. But there she is in &lt;i&gt;The Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;, the mysterious tabloid that is airing her hometown&#39;s dirty laundry. Alongside stories of high school rivalries and truck-bed love affairs, disturbing revelations about Amiah&#39;s past and present are selling papers and fuelling small-town gossip. As the stakes get higher, Amiah must either expose the twisted truth behind &lt;i&gt;The Inquirer&lt;/i&gt; or watch her life fall apart again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaclyn Dawn&#39;s debut novel provides an incisive look at the lingering consequences of past relationships and the price of both staying silent and speaking up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A clever novel that reveals both the anxieties and strengths woven into tight-knit communities. The Inquirer is a thoroughly enjoyable read.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Lisa Guenther, author of &lt;i&gt;Friendly Fire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;In &lt;i&gt;The Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;, Jaclyn Dawn has crafted something so rare--a great story full of fascinating characters, sly humour, and understated intelligence--that news of its appearance might just get reported in the tabloids her novel so lovingly satirizes. Amiah Williams&#39;s journey back to her hometown of Kingsley, Alberta, is funny and winning, neither of which factors obscure the troubling realities young women too often face.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Curtis Gillespie, author of &lt;i&gt;Almost There&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A bildungsroman that never drags, Dawn&#39;s debut novel is appealing both in its innovation--it intersperses newspaper articles from the Inquirer throughout--and its unexpected insights from Amiah, its well-drawn narrator.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
