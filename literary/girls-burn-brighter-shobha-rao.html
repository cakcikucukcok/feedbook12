After her mother&#39;s death, Poornima has very little kindness in her life. She is left to care for her siblings until her father can find her a suitable match. So when Savitha enters their household, Poornima is intrigued by the joyful, independent-minded girl. Suddenly their Indian village doesn&#39;t feel quite so claustrophobic, and Poornima begins to imagine a life beyond arranged marriage. But when a devastating act of cruelty drives Savitha away, Poornima leaves behind everything she has ever known to find her friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her journey takes her into the darkest corners of India&#39;s underworld, on a harrowing cross-continental journey, and eventually to an apartment complex in Seattle. Alternating between the girls&#39; perspectives as they face ruthless obstacles, Shobha Rao&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Girls Burn Brighter &lt;/i&gt;introduces two heroines who never lose the hope that burns within.&lt;/p&gt;" />
