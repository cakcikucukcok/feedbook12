  <title>The Grip of It - Jac Jemc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist for the&lt;i&gt; Chicago Review of Books &lt;/i&gt;Fiction Award, Dan Chaon&#39;s Best of 2017 pick in &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, one of &lt;i&gt;Vol. 1 Brooklyn&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Books of 2017, a &lt;i&gt;BOMB&lt;/i&gt; Magazine &quot;Looking Back on 2017: Literature&quot; Pick, and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;one of Vulture&#39;s 10 Best Thriller Books of 2017.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jac Jemc&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Grip of It&lt;/i&gt; is a chilling literary horror novel about a young couple haunted by their newly purchased home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Touring their prospective suburban home, Julie and James are stopped by a noise. Deep and vibrating, like throat singing. Ancient, husky, and rasping, but underwater. &quot;That&#39;s just the house settling,&quot; the real estate agent assures them with a smile. He is wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The move--prompted by James&#39;s penchant for gambling and his general inability to keep his impulses in check--is quick and seamless; both Julie and James are happy to start afresh. But this house, which sits between a lake and a forest, has its own plans for the unsuspecting couple. As Julie and James try to establish a sense of normalcy, the home and its surrounding terrain become the locus of increasingly strange happenings. The framework-- claustrophobic, riddled with hidden rooms within rooms--becomes unrecognizable, decaying before their eyes. Stains are animated on the wall--contracting, expanding--and map themselves onto Julie&#39;s body in the form of painful, grisly bruises. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the house that torments the troubled married couple living within its walls, &lt;i&gt;The Grip of It &lt;/i&gt;oozes with palpable terror and skin-prickling dread. Its architect, Jac Jemc, meticulously traces Julie and James&#39;s unsettling journey through the depths of their new home as they fight to free themselves from its crushing grip.&lt;/p&gt;" />
