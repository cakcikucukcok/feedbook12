  <title>My Home Street Home - Val Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dramatic changes in life can happen at any time. She has lost her mother to cancer, and she&#39;s drifting along, alone, in a small town with little excitement in her life. Then she meets Eddie Weston, and everything changes-first for the better and then for the worst.&lt;/p&gt; 
Living with Eddie in a large city, her life takes an upward shift. But through an act of fate, hateful words, and an unforgivable act of betrayal, she finds herself alone again-only this time with no place to stay, no place to call home. She is nameless, and now lives with the downtrodden on the streets of Edmonton.&lt;/p&gt; 
Fortunately, she meets Mr. Taylor, a leader of sorts in the homeless community. She learns to get along with an odd cast of street people, from Hannah, a Goth teen who stomps around in beaten-up Dr. Martens, to Betty, an exotic, gypsy type, a caring person with a dark side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;My Home Street Home&lt;/I&gt; is a powerful, eye-opening tale about how quickly a life can be forever altered, and the struggle to survive on the street." />
