  <title>The Carpetbaggers - Harold Robbins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A LEGENDARY MASTERPIECE &lt;br&gt;A STORY OF MONEY AND POWER, &lt;br&gt;SEX AND DEATH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonas Cord coveted his father&#39;s fame, fortune, even his young, beautiful wife.  When his father died, Jonas swore to possess them all.  But Rina Marlow was the celebrated screen goddess no man could master.  Her sizzling sensuality might inflame and enthrall millions, but her personal boudoir was no Hollywood fantasy.  She consumed her lovers on the fiery rack of her burning desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rina and Jonas took Hollywood, the airplane industry, America itself by storm.  From New York to LA they brawled, lusted, and carved out an empire, blazoned in banner headlines and their enemies&#39; blood--only to learn that money and power, revenge and renown were not enough.  Too much would never be enough--not for Jonas Cord and the relentless Rina Marlowe.  The higher they soared, the more their ambition demanded . . . the darker and deadlier their fiery passions grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
