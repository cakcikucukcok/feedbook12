  <title>Nobody Is Ever Missing - Catherine Lacey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Without telling her family, Elyria takes a one-way flight to New Zealand, abruptly leaving her stable but unfulfilling life in Manhattan. As her husband scrambles to figure out what happened to her, Elyria hurtles into the unknown, testing fate by hitchhiking, tacitly being swept into the lives of strangers, and sleeping in fields, forests, and public parks.&lt;br&gt;     Her risky and often surreal encounters with the people and wildlife of New Zealand propel Elyria deeper into her deteriorating mind. Haunted by her sister&#39;s death and consumed by an inner violence, her growing rage remains so expertly concealed that those who meet her sense nothing unwell. This discord between her inner and outer reality leads her to another obsession: If her truest self is invisible and unknowable to others, is she even alive?&lt;br&gt;     The risks Elyria takes on her journey are paralleled by the risks Catherine Lacey takes on the page. In urgent, spiraling prose she whittles away at the rage within Elyria and exposes the very real, very knowable anxiety of the human condition. And yet somehow Lacey manages to poke fun at her unrelenting self-consciousness, her high-stakes search for the dark heart of the self. In the spirit of Haruki Murakami and Amelia Gray, &lt;i&gt;Nobody Is Ever Missing&lt;/i&gt; is full of mordant humor and uncanny insights, as Elyria waffles between obsession and numbness in the face of love, loss, danger, and self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;" />

She is the winner of a 2016 Whiting Award, a finalist for the NYPL's Young Lions Fiction Award, and a NYFA fellow.<br /><b><i>Nobody Is Ever Missing by Catherine Lacey - Goodreads</i></b> | “Catherine Lacey's remarkably immersive and morbidly humorous debut, Nobody Is Ever Missing, reminds one of Esther Greenwood from Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. . . As Elyria increasingly feels that she is ‘a human non sequitur' and perhaps ‘a form of radiation,' Lacey brilliantly captures her decline through long, winding sentences.<br /><b><i>Nobody Is Ever Missing: Lacey, Catherine: 9780374534493 ...</i></b> | Catherine Lacey's prose rhythmically weaves in and out of past and present with a tender, strange, and dark sophistication. "Nobody is Ever Missing" has revealed a young author's unique and striking talent, reminding the reader of Sylvia Plath's "The Bell Jar".
