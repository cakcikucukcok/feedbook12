  <title>Clamor of the Lake - Mohamed El-Bisatie, Hala Halim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Clamor of the Lake &lt;/em&gt;begins with the appearance of an old fisherman of unknown origin sailing a black boat. Taciturn and enigmatic, he takes on a woman and her twin boys. While he gives away nothing about his past, his undemanding companionship prompts the woman to narrate her turbulent life. Meanwhile, in a nearby village by the lake, Gomaa and his wife have found respite from the dreariness of their existence in the fantastic objects the sea churns up during gales a sword, alluring panties, a talisman. But when the waves cast up a chest that speaks in a language no one can comprehend, Gomaa is haunted by its voice. As the tumult of the lake drives a wedge between the couple, it turns two neighbors into close allies: Karawia, a caf&amp;#233; proprietor, and Afifi, a grocer. Eventually, they too will be haunted by the siren song of the lake.
In Mohamed El-Bisatie&#39;s lyrical novel, the stories of these various figures converge on the mercurial presence of the lake, which in the end proves the narrative&#39;s true hero. An accomplished experiment in the poetics of space, &lt;em&gt;Clamor of the Lake&lt;/em&gt; won the 1995 Cairo International Book Fair Award for Best Novel of the Year." />
