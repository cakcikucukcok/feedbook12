  <title>The Other Joseph - Skip Horack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A masterful depiction of a life driven off the rails by tragedy and sin&amp;#8212;a man now summoned by the legacy of a beloved, lost brother to embark on a journey in search toward understanding, happiness, and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haunted by the disappearance of his older brother Tommy in the first Gulf War, the tragic deaths of his parents, and the felony conviction that has branded him for a decade, Roy Joseph has labored in lonesome exile&amp;#8212;and under the ever-watchful eyes of the law&amp;#8212;moving between oil rigs off the coast of Louisiana and an Airstream trailer he shares with his dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on the cusp of his thirtieth birthday, Roy is contacted by a teenage girl from California claiming to be his lost brother&amp;#39;s biological daughter. Yearning for connection and the prospect of family, Roy embarks on a journey across America, visiting childhood haunts in the South to confront his troubled memories and history, and making a stop in Nevada to call on a retired Navy SEAL who may hold the answer to Tommy&amp;#39;s fate. The ultimate destination is San Francisco, where a potential Russian bride and his long-lost niece await, and Roy may finally recover the Joseph line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Other Joseph&lt;/em&gt;, Skip Horack delivers a powerful, spellbinding tale of a man nearly defeated by life who is given one last chance at redemption&amp;#8212;one last shot to find meaning and alter the course of his solitary existence&lt;/p&gt;" />
