  <title>In the Heart of the Dark Wood - Billy Coffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A motherless girl hungry for hope . . . and the dream that could be leading her astray.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost two years have passed since twelve-year-old Allie Granderson&amp;rsquo;s beloved mother, Mary, disappeared into the wild tornado winds. Her body has never been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allie clings to memories of her mother, just as she clings to the broken compass she left behind, the makeshift Nativity scene in the front yard, and her best friend Zach. But even with Zach at her side, the compass on her wrist, and the Nativity right outside the window, Allie cannot help but feel lost in all the growing up that must get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Holy Mother disappears from the yard, Allie&amp;rsquo;s bewilderment is compounded by the sudden movement of her mother&amp;rsquo;s compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the needle, Allie and Zach leave the city behind and push into the inky forest on the outskirts of Mattingly. For Allie, the journey is more than a ghost hunt: she is rejoining the mother she lost&amp;mdash;and finding herself with each step deeper into the heart of the dark wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brimming with lyrical prose and unexpected discoveries, &lt;em&gt;In the Heart of the Dark Wood &lt;/em&gt;illustrates the steep transition we all must undergo&amp;mdash;the moment we shed our childlike selves and step into the strange territory of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
