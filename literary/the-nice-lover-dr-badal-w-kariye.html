  <title>The Nice Lover - Dr. Badal W. Kariye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel is based on true history of love, jealousy of polygamy, betrayal, and how you can survive it in a foreign country where you&#39;ve arrived in as a refugee or immigrant in love who needs constant assistance from the government and local charity organizations.
It&#39;s very hard to fall in love with somebody or forget your lover easily when the lover immigrates to a foreign nation where you can&#39;t communicate with your lover even if she or he doesn&#39;t communicate with you frequently.
Let me tell you love needs special medication, and the true medication is the reunification of the beloved lovers who went apart for sometime regardless any issues and whatsoever separated them.
This novel will also help you if you&#39;re a refugee or an immigrant in the United States of America because it&#39;ll teach you whatever you may need as new a refugee or an immigrant until you fully become a true citizen of the United States of America while you&#39;ll be overcoming the obstacles in your love and the lifestyle in America.
I wrote this novel for you to simply enjoy and learn how you can survive in love and your life in the United States of America, and it&#39;s truly based on lovers whom I missed them to marry, and how they really survived in their new American lifestyle.
Following the right footsteps of your honesty love can mislead you sometimes, and you&#39;ll be in the middle of nowhere. Hopefully, this novel can help you to master love, find solution for its obstacles and adjust your new lifestyle peacefully in America.
This is also intended for every lover who likes to experiment the meaning of a true love that ends in endless lies and a disastrous jealousy of separation forever between two beloved lovers.
Enjoy with me as you&#39;re reading something valuable to your new life adjustment in love and America.
Good Luck!" />
