  <title>Reunited - R. N. Noveck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Will Fisher volunteers to recruit fellow alums he hasnt seen for forty-five years to attend the 2007 Alumni Reunion of the Poitiers American High School. As an American teenager coming-of-age in France in the late 1950s, Will has special memories of how joining the closely-knit military community made a life altering impact on him and his new friends. Until the reunion weekend, he didnt know how much of an impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reunited, The Life and Loves of an Army Brat&lt;/i&gt;, is a nostalgic, intricately plotted, multi-generational novel of how Will, through conversations on the phone and during the reunion weekend, relives his unique high school experiences in France and how he and the first two loves of his life, SueAnn and Sloane, have fared since their return to the U.S. His Army Brat background helps him bond with Gina, his future wife, and how, through a
Fisher family connection, Gina discovers the details of her deceased mothers experiences during the  Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the reunions closing brunch at Wills and Ginas home, SueAnns glancing at a photo, triggers a long suppressed memory that leads to a stunning discovery that SueAnn, Will, and their families have to resolve. &lt;/p&gt;" />
