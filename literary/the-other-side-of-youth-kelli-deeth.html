  <title>The Other Side of Youth - Kelli Deeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Kelli Deeth&#39;s female protagonists confront the emotional complexities of marriage, childlessness, adoption, adolescent longing, friendship, and death; they mourn the loss of youth while grappling with the uncertainties of adulthood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &quot;Vera&amp;#8217;s Room,&quot; a woman who is unable to conceive negotiates a tense relationship with the seven-year-old girl she and her husband have adopted. In &quot;Embrace,&quot; Theresa, a young woman who has just had an abortion decides to give up on sexual desire and settle with a divorced father who can provide her with safety. And in &quot;Sis,&quot; Jenny moves back to Toronto from Winnipeg in order to start her life over and reconnect with her step-brother, with whom she shares complicated and tragic childhood.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These are stories about the vagaries of family and the narrow chasm between longing and grief; with a deft hand and a knowing eye, Kelli Deeth creates stories that are devastating, incisive portraits of dysfunction and desire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kelli Deeth&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s first book, &lt;I&gt;The Girl without Anyone&lt;/I&gt; (HarperCollins Canada), was a &lt;I&gt;Globe and Mail&lt;/I&gt; best book of 2001. She teaches writing at the University of Toronto.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
