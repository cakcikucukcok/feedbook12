  <title>Plan B - Jonathan Tropper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The heartwarming debut novel by the New York Times bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;This is Where I Leave You &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;One Last Thing Before I Go.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning thirty was never supposed to be like this. Ten years ago, Ben, Lindsey, Chuck, Alison, and Jack graduated from New York University and went out into the world, fresh-faced and full of dreams for the future. But now Ben&#39;s getting a divorce; Lindsey&#39;s unemployed; Alison and Chuck seem stuck in ruts of their own making; and Jack is getting more publicity for his cocaine addiction than his multimillion-dollar Hollywood successes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, turning thirty-- past the age their parents were when they were born, older than every current star athlete or pop music sensation-- seems to be both more meaningful and less than they&#39;d imagined ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Plan B&lt;/i&gt;, Jonathan Tropper&#39;s wonderful debut novel, is about more than friendship, love, celebrity, addiction, kidnapping, or even turning thirty-- it&#39;s a heartfelt comic riff on what it means to be an adult against your will, to be single when you thought you&#39;d have a family, to discover you are not, in fact, immortal, and to learn that &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; is as good a life lesson today as it was when you were six years old.&lt;/p&gt;" />
