  <title>River Angel - A. Manette Ansay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In April 1991, in a little Wisconsin town about a hundred miles southwest of the town where I grew up, a misfit boy was kidnapped by a group of high school kids who, later, would testify they&#39;d merely meant to frighten him, to drive him around for a while. Somehow they ended up at the rive, whooping and hollering on a two-lane bridge. Somehow the boy was shoved, he jumped, he slipped&amp;#8212;acounts vary&amp;#8212;into the icy water. The kids told police they never heard a splash; one reported seeing a brilliant flash of light. (Several people in the area witnessed a similar light, while others recalled hearing something &quot;kind of like thunder.&quot;) All night, volunteers walked the river&#39;s edge, but it was dawn before the body was found in a barn a good mile from the bridge . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of the barn had been the one to discover the body, and she said the boy&#39;s cheeks were rosy, his skin warm to the touch. A sweet smell hung in the air. &quot;It was,&quot; she said &quot;as if he were just sleeping.&quot; And then she told police she believed an angel had carried him there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, it had been said that an angel lived in the river. Residents flipped coins into the water for luck, and a few claimed they had seen the angel, or known someone who&#39;d seen it. The historical society downtown had a farmwife&#39;s journal, dated 1898, in which a woman described how an angel had rescued her family from a flood. Now, as the story of the boy&#39;s death spread, more people came forward with accounts of strange things that had happened on that night. Dogs had barked without ceasing till dawn; livestock broke free of padlocked barns. Someone&#39;s child crayoned a bridge and, above it, a wide-winged tapioca angel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A miracle? A hoax? Or something in between? With acute insight and great compassion, A. Manette Ansay captures the inner life of a town and its residents struggling to forge a new identity in the face of a rapidly changing world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
