  <title>A Crack in Everything - Vanessa Carlisle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Get ready: while other books may show up carefully dressed, this one answers the door in her underwear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARK, Author, Artist, Creative Fountain, PlanetSARK.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; a new, exciting voice in fictionA truly impressive debut novel that announces Carlisle as a writer to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Roberge, author of Working Backwards from the Worst Moment of My Life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The characters that inhabit this sharp and witty novel are troubled, impoverished, confused, lost, sexually frustrated, and intellectually unfulfilled. Sobasically everyone I know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Barker, Co-Creator and Head Writer, American Dad! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; saucy writing yet tender and heart-felt charactersbridges an unusual but empowering sisterhood between girls-next-door and girls-on-stripper-poles. Its about time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Musselman, author of Own It! The Ups &amp; Downs of Homebuying for Women Who Go It Alone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Tamina is a sharp-witted Jersey girl living in Hollywood with a near-phobic response to mismatching colors, an addiction to pedicures, and a hectic job teaching comprehensive sex education to urban youth. Suffering the consequences of a violent assault, Tam looks for relief in romance and LAs underground erotic entertainment scene. However, when Tams young attacker unexpectedly resurfaces among a crowd of drag queens, porn stars, and musicians, Tam finally must make real choices. Fear or confrontation. Cynicism or curiosity. Silence or honesty. It would be surreal, if it wasnt LA.&lt;/p&gt;" />
