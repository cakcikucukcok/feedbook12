  <title>The Ship - Antonia Honeywell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In this thought-provoking and lyrical debut novel, a young woman&#39;s only hope for survival in the dystopian future is a ship, a Noah&#39;s Ark, that can rescue 500 people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;London burned for three weeks. And then it got worse...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Young, naive, and frustratingly sheltered, Lalla has grown up in near-isolation in her parents&#39; apartment, sheltered from the chaos of their collapsed civilization. But things are getting more dangerous outside. People are killing each other for husks of bread, and the police are detaining anyone without an identification card. On her sixteenth birthday, Lalla&#39;s father decides it&#39;s time to use their escape route--a ship he&#39;s built that is only big enough to save five hundred people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the utopia her father has created isn&#39;t everything it appears. There&#39;s more food than anyone can eat, but nothing grows; more clothes than anyone can wear, but no way to mend them; and no-one can tell her where they are going." />
