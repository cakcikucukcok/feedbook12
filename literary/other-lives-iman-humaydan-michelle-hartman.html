  <title>Other Lives - Iman Humaydan, Michelle Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In Other Lives, Myriam&amp;#8217;s travels take her from her Shouf mountain village to Beirut, Melbourne and Paradise, Australia to Nairobi, Mombasa and Cape Town. Unwilling to be tied down by geography, language or men, Myriam forges a path through the world that is at once hers uniquely and also deeply informed by her life&amp;#8217;s experiences. Again and again, she is drawn back to the Lebanon of her birth and childhood, only to find it no longer there. She is forced to confront the ghosts of the civil war&amp;#151;her dead brother, her disappeared lover, and the life that she left behind when she immigrated to Australia. Humaydan deftly explores one woman&amp;#8217;s negotiation of love and war, intimacy and loss, migration and home in a way that speaks beyond individual but to a collective experience.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

    	<p>In Other Lives, Myriam’s travels take her from her Shouf mountain village to Beirut, Melbourne and Paradise, Australia to Nairobi, Mombasa and Cape Town. Unwilling to be tied down by geography, language or men, Myriam forges a path through the world that is at once hers uniquely and also deeply informed by her life’s experiences. Again and again, she is drawn back to the Lebanon of her birth and childhood, only to find it no longer there. She is forced to confront the ghosts of the civil warher dead brother, her disappeared lover, and the life that she left behind when she immigrated to Australia. Humaydan deftly explores one woman’s negotiation of love and war, intimacy and loss, migration and home in a way that speaks beyond individual but to a collective experience.</p><p></p>
