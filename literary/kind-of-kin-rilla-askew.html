[Rilla Askew] suggests a very subversive thought. Perhaps we are all a kind of kin. No matter your politics, you will not soon forget this generous work of art.” (Luis Alberto Urrea, author of Queen of America)<br /><b><i>Kind of Kin: A Novel: Askew, Rilla: 9780062198808: Amazon ...</i></b> | Rilla Askew is an Oklahoma author who not only understands her people but also paints them in true colors on the pallete of her pages. Kind of Kin is an easy read, much easier than Fire in Beulah or her seminal The Mercy Seat , but this breezy narrative, nonetheless, is powerful and her voice is emphatic.<br /><b><i>Kind of Kin by Rilla Askew - Goodreads</i></b> | Using new laws in Oklahoma and Alabama as inspiration, Kind of Kin is a story of self-serving lawmakers and complicated lawbreakers, Christian principle and political scapegoating.
