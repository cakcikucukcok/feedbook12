  <title>Erasure - Percival Everett</title>

He doesn&#39;t intend for &lt;i&gt;My Pafology &lt;/i&gt;to be published, let alone taken seriously, but it is--under the pseudonym Stagg R. Leigh--and soon it becomes the Next Big Thing. How Monk deals with the personal and professional fallout galvanizes this audacious, hysterical, and quietly devastating novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
