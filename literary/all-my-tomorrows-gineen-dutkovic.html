  <title>All My Tomorrows - Gineen Dutkovic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While everyone else is diving headfirst into the pool of life, 23 year old Novena Fullerton can barely manage to wade in up to her ankles.  She longs to immerse herself and splash around in all life has to offer but not without a safety net. Her life ring comes in the form of her boyfriend Dev.  With one hand on his strong arm she can float along without the fear of going under. When Dev enters the dark waters of heroin use Novena plunges in after him. What starts as an attempt to help their friend Mick spirals into addiction. All Novena can do is hang on and hope she washes safely up on shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in Pittsburgh in the 1990s, Novenas journey is peopled by characters as compassionate as they are depraved. They offer levity, insight and wisdom, usually when she least wants it. Novena tells her story with compelling intimacy, sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes humorous. We get swept along as she flows from dependency to desperation to a life she never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
