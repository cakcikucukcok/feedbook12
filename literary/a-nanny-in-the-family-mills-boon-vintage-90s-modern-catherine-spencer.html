          &lt;strong&gt;NANNY WANTED &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By a lively, lonely four-year-old… and his handsome, eligible guardian… Pierce Wagner was getting used to changes in his once orderly life, now that he was responsible for his cousin&#39;s little boy. Apart from having a four-year-old running riot through his luxury home, he was also having to take orders from Tommy&#39;s beautiful but headstrong new nanny!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nicole&#39;s natural flair with Tommy soon bowled Pierce over, and not only was he now playing father, he was also considering another new role - as Nicole&#39;s husband. Would he still want to marry Nicole when he discovered that she had failed to tell him one important detail about herself - something that would explain her immediate bond with Tommy… ?&lt;/p&gt;
