  <title>The Private Lives of Pippa Lee - Rebecca Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At fifty, Pippa Lee seems just fine. The devoted wife of a brilliant publisher thirty years her senior, the proud mother of successful twins, and a lovely and adored friend and neighbor, she seems to glow with feminine serenity. But when her husband spontaneously decides they should cast off Gramercy Park for Marigold Village retirement home as a &quot;preemptive strike against his decrepitude,&quot; Pippa finds her beatific persona unraveling in alarming ways: the truth is that the gracious woman of the present day has seen more than her fair share of the wild side. By seventeen, Pippa had lived with a Dexedrine-addicted mother, felt the first stirrings of sexuality with a school girlfriend, had an affair with a teacher, and run away from home, set adrift on a course littered with broken hearts--until she seemingly found love and security in a family of her own. And now that established world, too, is in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pippa Lee we have an unforgettable heroine, and a quirky and acutely intelligent portrait of the many lives behind a single name. Even after we&#39;ve read it, &lt;i&gt;The Private Lives of Pippa Lee &lt;/i&gt;is a story that is still unfurling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
