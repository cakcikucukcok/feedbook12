  <title>Manazuru - Hiromi  Kawakami, Michael Emmerich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Twelve years have passed since Kei&amp;#8217;s husband, Rei, disappeared and she was left alone with her three-year-old daughter. Her new relationship with a married man&amp;#151;the antithesis of Rei&amp;#151;has brought her life to a numbing stasis, and her relationships with her mother and daughter have spilled into routine, day after day. Kei begins making repeated trips to the seaside town of Manazuru, a place that jogs her memory to a moment in time she can never quite locate. Her time there by the water encompasses years of unsteady footing and a developing urgency to find &lt;I&gt;something&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Through a poetic style embracing the surreal and grotesque, a quiet tenderness emerges from these dark moments. &lt;I&gt;Manazuru&lt;/I&gt; is a meditation on memory&amp;#151;a profound, precisely delineated exploration of the relationships between lovers and family members. Both startlingly restless and immaculately compact, &lt;I&gt;Manazuru&lt;/I&gt; paints the portrait of a woman on the brink of her own memories and future.&lt;/div&gt;" />
