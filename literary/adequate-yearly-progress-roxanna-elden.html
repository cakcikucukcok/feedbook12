  <title>Adequate Yearly Progress - Roxanna Elden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the mundane to the insane,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Adequate Yearly Progress&lt;/em&gt;captures the teaching experience with insight, humor, and heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year brings familiar educational challenges to Brae Hill Valley, a struggling urban high school in Texas. But the school&amp;rsquo;s teachers face plenty of challenges of their own. English teacher Lena Wright, a spoken-word poet with a deep love for her roots, can never seem to satisfy her students that she&amp;rsquo;s for real. Hernan D. Hernandez is confident in front of his biology classes, yet tongue-tied around the woman he most wants to impress: namely, Lena. Down the hall, math teacher Maybelline Galang focuses on the numbers as she blocks out problems whose solutions aren&amp;rsquo;t so clear, while Coach Ray hustles his football team toward another winning season, at least on the field. Recording it all is idealistic history teacher Kaytee Mahoney, whose blog gains new readers by the day but drifts ever further from her in-class reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this year, a new celebrity superintendent is determined to leave his own mark on the school&amp;mdash;even if that means shutting the whole place down. The fallout will shake up the teachers&amp;rsquo; lives both inside and outside the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
