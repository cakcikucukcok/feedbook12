  <title>In Bed with the Devil / High-Society Mistress: In Bed with the Devil (Millionaire of the Month, Book 6) / High-Society Mistress (The Mistresses, Book 3) (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Susan Mallery, Katherine Garbera</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Be swept away by passion… with intense drama and compelling plots, these emotionally powerful reads will keep you captivated from beginning to end.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;In Bed with the Devil &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Susan Mallery &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When he arrived at Hunter’s Landing, Jack found his best friend’s shy little sister had become a breathtaking woman – with an axe to grind. Still smarting over Jack’s long ago rejection, Meredith was intent on luring the millionaire mogul into her bed…and her bed was right across the hall. Could Jack keep a decade-old promise?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;High-Society Mistress &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Katherine Garbera &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Refused a promotion by her tycoon father, heiress Tempest Lambert offered her services to his worst enemy, devastatingly handsome Gavin Renard, who had made millions as a corporate raider. Gavin still had a score to settle; using Tempest as a pawn in his takeover game was tempting. Making her his mistress – that was an offer he couldn’t refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
