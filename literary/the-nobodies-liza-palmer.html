  <title>The Nobodies - Liza Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Liza Palmer&#39;s voice is fresh, exciting, and necessary. She&#39;s a must-read author.&quot; --Taylor Jenkins Reid, author of &lt;i&gt;Daisy Jones &amp; the Six&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charmingly candid, hilarious, and deeply moving, &lt;i&gt;The Nobodies &lt;/i&gt;is a novel about failing but never losing the core of yourself, from a beloved writer at the top of her game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s one thing Joan Dixon knows about herself, it&#39;s that she is a damn good journalist. But when she is laid off from yet another soon-to-be-shuttered newspaper, and even the soulless, listicle-writing online jobs have dried up, she is left with few options. Closer to 40 than 30, single, living with her parents again, Joan decides she needs to reinvent herself. She goes to work as a junior copywriter at Bloom, a Los Angeles startup where her bosses are all a decade younger and snacks and cans of fizzy water flow freely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For once, Joan has a steady paycheck and a stable job. She befriends a group of misfit coworkers and even begins a real relationship, after years of false starts. But once a journalist, always a journalist, and as Joan starts to poke beneath Bloom&#39;s bright surface, she realizes that she may have accidentally stumbled onto the scoop of her lifetime. Is it worth risking everything for the sake of the story?&lt;/p&gt;" />
