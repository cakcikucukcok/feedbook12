      <meta name="description" content="&quot;??Neither the old man nor Boga ever said more than was needed. And yet they understood each other perfectly.&quot;?? Over the course of a season, Boga and the old man work side by side on the sandbanks of the Paran치 Delta, cutting reeds to sell to local basketweavers. But when the old man falls sick and dies, Boga abandons himself entirely to the river and the life of solitary drifting he has long yearned for. Echoes of John Berger sound throughout the evocative prose of this great Argentinan writer. A twentieth-century classic, Southeaster is a central work in Haroldo Conti&quot;??s oeuvre." />

He was fifty-one years old. This first publication of his work in English introduces us not only to one of South America's finest twentieth-century writers but to a world view, a landscape and a unique literary vision that is essential to our time."<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Southeaster (9781908276605): Conti, Haroldo: Books</i></b> | Southeaster - Kindle edition by Conti, Haroldo.
