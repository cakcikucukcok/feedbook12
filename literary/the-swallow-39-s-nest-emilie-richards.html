  <title>The Swallow&#39;s Nest - Emilie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Three women fight for the chance to raise the child they&#39;ve all come to love&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Lilia Swallow&#39;s husband, Graham, goes into remission after a challenging year of treatment for lymphoma, the home and lifestyle blogger throws a party. Their best friends and colleagues attend to celebrate his recovery, but just as the party is in full swing, a new guest arrives. She presents Lilia with a beautiful baby boy, and vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Toby is Graham&#39;s darkest secret—his son, conceived in a moment of despair. Lilia is utterly unprepared for the betrayal the baby represents, and perhaps more so for the love she begins to feel once her shock subsides. Now this unasked-for precious gift becomes a life changer for three women: Lilia, who takes him into her home and heart; Marina, who bore and abandoned him until circumstance and grief changed her mind; and Ellen, who sees in him a chance to correct the mistakes she made with her own son, Toby&#39;s father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A custody battle begins, and each would-be mother must examine her heart, confront her choices and weigh her dreams against the fate of one vulnerable little boy. Each woman will redefine family, belonging and love—and the results will alter the course of not only their lives, but also the lives of everyone they care for.&lt;/p&gt;
