  <title>Encircling 2 - Carl Frode Tiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Encircling 2&lt;/i&gt; continues Carl Frode Tiller&#39;s &quot;poised and effective &lt;i&gt;Rashomon&lt;/i&gt;-style exploration of multiple psyches&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book two of &lt;i&gt;The Encircling Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; continues piecing together the  fractured identity of David, the absent central figure who has lost his  memory. Three very different friends write letters about his childhood  on the backwater island of Otterøya. Ole, a farmer struggling to right  his floundering marriage, recalls days in the woods when an act of  pretending went very wrong. Tom Roger, a rough-edged outsider slipping  into domestic violence, shares a cruder side of David as he crows about  their exploits selling stolen motorcycles and spreads gossip about who  David&#39;s father might be. But it is Paula, a former midwife now consigned  to a nursing home, who has the most explosive secret of all, one that  threatens to undo everything we know about David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a  carefully scored polyphony of voices and an unwavering attention to  domestic life, Carl Frode Tiller shows how deeply identity is influenced by our  friendships. &lt;i&gt;The Encircling Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; is an innovative portrayal of one man&#39;s life that is both starkly honest and unnervingly true.&lt;/p&gt;" />
