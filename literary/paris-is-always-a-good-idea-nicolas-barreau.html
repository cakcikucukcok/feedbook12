  <title>Paris Is Always a Good Idea - Nicolas Barreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rosalie Laurent is the proud owner of Luna Luna, a little post-card shop in St. Germain, and if it were up to her, far more people would write cards. Her specialty is producing &quot;wishing cards,&quot; but where her own wishes are concerned the quirky graphic artist is far from lucky. Every birthday Rosalie sends a card inscribed with her heart&#39;s desire fluttering down from the Eiffel Tower - but none of her wishes has ever been fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one day when an elderly gentleman trips up in her shop and knocks over a post-card stand, it seems that her wish cards are working after-all. Rosalie finds out that it is Max Marchais, famed and successful author of children&#39;s books who&#39;s fallen into her life. When he asks her to illustrate his new (and probably last) book, Rosalie is only too glad to accept, and the two - very different - maverick artists become friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosalie&#39;s wishes seem to be coming true at last, until a clumsy American professor stumbles into her store with accusations of plagiarism. Rosalie is hard pressed to know whether love or trouble is blowing through her door these days, but when in doubt, she knows that &lt;i&gt;Paris is Always a Good Idea&lt;/i&gt; when one is looking for the truth and finding love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
