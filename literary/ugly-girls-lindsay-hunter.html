  <title>Ugly Girls - Lindsay Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Perry and Baby Girl are best friends, though you wouldn&#39;t know it if you met them. Their friendship is woven from the threads of never-ending dares and power struggles, their loyalty fierce but incredibly fraught. They spend their nights sneaking out of their trailers, stealing cars for joyrides, and doing all they can to appear hard to the outside world.With all their energy focused on deceiving themselves and the people around them, they don&#39;t know that real danger lurks: Jamey, an alleged high school student from a nearby town, has been pining after Perry from behind the computer screen in his mother&#39;s trailer for some time now, following Perry and Baby Girl&#39;s every move--on Facebook, via instant messaging and text,and, unbeknownst to the girls, in person. When Perry and Baby Girl finally agree to meet Jamey face-to-face, they quickly realize he&#39;s far from the shy high school boy they thought he was, and they&#39;ll do whatever is necessary to protect themselves. Lindsay Hunter&#39;s stories have been called &quot;mesmerizing. . . visceral . . . exquisite&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/i&gt;), and in &lt;i&gt;Ugly Girls &lt;/i&gt;she calls on all her faculties as a wholly original storyteller to deliver the most searing, poignant, powerful debut novel in years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
