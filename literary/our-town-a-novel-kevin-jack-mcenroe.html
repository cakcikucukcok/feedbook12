  <title>Our Town: A Novel - Kevin Jack McEnroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Our Town&lt;/I&gt; is the debut of a striking literary voice, one that captures the disillusion at the fringes of Hollywood as seen through a haze of drugs, alcohol, abuse, and fallen aspirations.  An unseen narrator guides us through the dark fairy tale of Dorothy White, an aspiring actress who &amp;#147;never quite figured how to get out of her own way.&amp;#8221;  Her perfect marriage to an equally golden actor, Dale, quickly turns into one of jealousy and violence. Dorothy ends the marriage yet begins a legacy of self-destruction for the failed couple, as well as their two children, Clover and Dylan.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we see the pathos in Dorothy&amp;#8217;s attempts to get back on track, to be a good woman, mother, and grandmother. Throughout the novel, she is left in the wake of decisions that turn disastrous. Her downward spiral from elusive fame into consistent infamy&amp;#151;a series of DUIs, the continuing neglect of her children, a string of failed and unhealthy relationships&amp;#151;is not without its grace, with the warmth of her character shining through her spackled makeup and cloud of acrid perfume. In many ways, Dorothy White is an anti-heroine for the ages&amp;#151;&amp;#147;vanilla voiced,&amp;#8221; bewigged, loving, and ever radiant &amp;#151;a sympathetic character caught in the riptide of her transformation from small-town southern girl to one-time toast of Hollywood to embarrassing tabloid fodder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;Our Town&lt;/I&gt; is an original and startling debut novel, one whose fresh voice and expert perspective reinvents the Hollywood story for a new generation of readers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
