  <title>Someone - Alice Mcdermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fully realized portrait of one woman&#39;s life in all its complexity, by the National Book Award-winning author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ordinary life--its sharp pains and unexpected joys, its bursts of clarity and moments of confusion--lived by an ordinary woman: this is the subject of &lt;i&gt;Someone&lt;/i&gt;, Alice McDermott&#39;s extraordinary return, seven years after the publication of &lt;i&gt;After This&lt;/i&gt;. Scattered recollections--of childhood, adolescence, motherhood, old age--come together in this transformative narrative, stitched into a vibrant whole by McDermott&#39;s deft, lyrical voice.&lt;br&gt;     Our first glimpse of Marie is as a child: a girl in glasses waiting on a Brooklyn stoop for her beloved father to come home from work. A seemingly innocuous encounter with a young woman named Pegeen sets the bittersweet tone of this remarkable novel. Pegeen describes herself as an &quot;amadan,&quot; a fool; indeed, soon after her chat with Marie, Pegeen tumbles down her own basement stairs. The magic of McDermott&#39;s novel lies in how it reveals us all as fools for this or that, in one way or another.&lt;br&gt;     Marie&#39;s first heartbreak and her eventual marriage; her brother&#39;s brief stint as a Catholic priest, subsequent loss of faith, and eventual breakdown; the Second World War; her parents&#39; deaths; the births and lives of Marie&#39;s children; the changing world of her Irish-American enclave in Brooklyn--McDermott sketches all of it with sympathy and insight. This is a novel that speaks of life as it is daily lived; a crowning achievement by one of the finest American writers at work today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; Best Fiction Book of the Year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;Best Fiction Book of 2013 &lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Notable Book of 2013 &lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Washington Post &lt;/i&gt;Notable Fiction Book of 2013 &lt;br&gt;An NPR Best Book of 2013&lt;/p&gt;" />
