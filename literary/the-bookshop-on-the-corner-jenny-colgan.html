  <title>The Bookshop on the Corner - Jenny Colgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nina Redmond is a librarian with a gift for finding the perfect book for her readers. But can she write her own happy-ever-after? In this valentine to readers, librarians, and book-lovers the world over, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times-&lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Little Beach Street Bakery&lt;/em&gt; returns with a funny, moving new novel for fans of Nina George&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Little Paris Bookshop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina is a literary matchmaker. Pairing a reader with that perfect book is her passion&amp;#8230; and also her job. Or at least it was. Until yesterday, she was a librarian in the hectic city. But now the job she loved is no more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to make a new life for herself, Nina moves to a sleepy village many miles away. There she buys a van and transforms it into a bookmobile &amp;#8212; a mobile bookshop that she drives from neighborhood to neighborhood, changing one life after another with the power of storytelling.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From helping her grumpy landlord deliver a lamb, to sharing picnics with a charming train conductor who serenades her with poetry, Nina discovers there&amp;#8217;s plenty of adventure, magic, and soul in a place that&amp;#8217;s beginning to feel like home&amp;#8230; a place where she just might be able to write her own happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;" />
