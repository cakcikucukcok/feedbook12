  <title>Scorned by the Boss / The Texan&#39;s Secret Past: Scorned by the Boss (Reasons for Revenge, Book 1) / The Texan&#39;s Secret Past (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Maureen Child, Peggy Moreland</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Be swept away by passion… with intense drama and compelling plots, these emotionally powerful reads will keep you captivated from beginning to end.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Scorned by the Boss &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Maureen Child&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When shipping tycoon Jefferson Lyon’s ‘faithful’ secretary finally had enough of his demanding ways and quit, he followed her to a tropical holiday resort. Jefferson was playing at seduction in order to get Caitlyn back to work. But his ex-assistant was turning out to be more determined, and more desirable, than the arrogant millionaire had ever realised.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Texan’s Secret Past &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Peggy Moreland &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She knew working for Jase Calhoun would amount to nothing but heartache. The wealthy rancher had never seen Mandy as anything more than the shy girl next door. But then the handsome Texan decided bedding Mandy would be perfect. Now that she’d slept with her boss, how could they ever go back to business?&lt;/p&gt;
