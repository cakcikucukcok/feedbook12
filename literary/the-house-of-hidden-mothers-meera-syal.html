  <title>The House of Hidden Mothers - Meera Syal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shyama, a forty-eight-year-old London divorcée, already has an unruly teenage daughter, but that doesn&#39;t stop her and her younger lover, Toby, from wanting a child together. Their relationship may look like a cliché, but despite the news from her doctor that she no longer has any viable eggs, Shyama&#39;s not ready to give up on their dream of having a baby. So they decide to find an Indian surrogate to carry their child, which is how they meet Mala, a young woman trapped in an oppressive marriage in a small Indian town from which she&#39;s desperate to escape. But as the pregnancy progresses, they discover that their simple arrangement may be far more complicated than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The House of Hidden Mothers&lt;/i&gt;, Meera Syal, an acclaimed British actress and accomplished novelist, takes on the timely but underexplored issue of India&#39;s booming surrogacy industry. Western couples pay a young woman to have their child and then fly home with a baby, an easy narrative that ignores the complex emotions involved in carrying a child. Syal turns this phenomenon into a compelling, thoughtful novel already hailed in the UK as &quot;rumbustious, confrontational and ultimately heartbreaking . . . Turn[s] the standard British-Asian displacement narrative on its head&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;). Compulsively readable and with a winning voice, &lt;i&gt;The House of Hidden Mothers&lt;/i&gt; deftly explores subjects of age, class, and the divide between East and West.&lt;/p&gt;" />
