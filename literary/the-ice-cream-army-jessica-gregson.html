      <meta name="description" content="Following an arduous and tragic sea journey to Australia, Hamil travels into the outback to find work and is taken in by a fellow Turkish immigrant. Initially they are widely accepted into the community as ice cream sellers and Halim as a Halal butcher. Supported by an ambitious teacher they look to offer lessons to the large migrant camp. However, as war breaks out, relations are strained and racial prejudice and violence replace previous acceptance. With the level of attack escalating and faced with being forced out of their home, the two men see only one option, leading to the peace of the community being irrevocably shattered." />
