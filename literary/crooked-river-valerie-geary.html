      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With the inventiveness and emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Promise Not to Tell, The Death of Bees, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;After Her&lt;/em&gt;, a powerful literary debut about family and friendship, good and evil, grief and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He is not evil. I am not good. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are the same: broken and put back together again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still grieving the sudden death of their mother, Sam and her younger sister Ollie McAlister move from the comforts of Eugene to rural Oregon to live in a meadow in a teepee under the stars with Bear, their beekeeper father. But soon after they arrive, a young woman is found dead floating in Crooked River, and the police arrest their eccentric father for the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Sam knows that Bear is not a killer, even though the evidence points to his guilt. Unwilling to accept that her father could have hurt anyone, Sam embarks on a desperate hunt to save him and keep her damaged family together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I see things no one else does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I see them there and wish I didn&amp;#8217;t. I want to tell and can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ollie, too, knows that Bear is innocent. The Shimmering have told her so. One followed her home from her mom&amp;#8217;s funeral and refuses to leave. Now, another is following Sam. Both spirits warn Ollie: the real killer is out there, closer and more dangerous than either girl can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in Sam and Ollie&amp;#8217;s vibrant voices, &lt;em&gt;Crooked River&lt;/em&gt; is a family story, a coming of age story, a ghost story, and a psychological mystery that will touch reader&amp;#8217;s hearts and keep them gripped until the final thrilling page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
