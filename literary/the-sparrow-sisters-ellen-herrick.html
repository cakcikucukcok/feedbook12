  <title>The Sparrow Sisters - Ellen Herrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A haunting, magical, modern-day fairytale.&amp;#160; A feast for the senses.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;Sarah Addison Allen,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestselling author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;First Frost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With echoes of the alchemy of &lt;em&gt;Practical Magic,&lt;/em&gt; the lushness of &lt;em&gt;Saving CeeCee Honeycutt&lt;/em&gt;, and the darkly joyful wickedness of the &lt;em&gt;Witches of Eastwick&lt;/em&gt;, Ellen Herrick&amp;#8217;s debut novel spins an enchanting love story about a place where magic whispers just beneath the surface and almost anything is possible, if you aren&amp;#8217;t afraid to listen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sparrow Sisters are as tightly woven into the seaside New England town of Granite Point as the wild sweet peas that climb the stone walls along the harbor. Sorrel, Nettie and Patience are as colorful as the beach plums on the dunes and as mysterious as the fog that rolls into town at dusk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patience is the town healer and when a new doctor settles into Granite Point he brings with him a mystery so compelling that Patience is drawn to love him, even as she struggles to mend him. But when Patience Sparrow&amp;#8217;s herbs and tinctures are believed to be implicated in a local tragedy, Granite Point is consumed by a long-buried fear&amp;#8212;and its three hundred year old history resurfaces as a modern day witch-hunt threatens. The plants and flowers, fruit trees and high hedges begin to wither and die, and the entire town begins to fail; fishermen return to the harbor empty-handed, and blight descends on the old elms that line the lanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems as if Patience and her town are lost until the women of Granite Point band together to save the Sparrow. As they gather, drawing strength from each other, will they be able to turn the tide and return life to Granite Point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sparrow Sisters&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful, haunting, and thoroughly mesmerizing novel that will capture your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;" />
