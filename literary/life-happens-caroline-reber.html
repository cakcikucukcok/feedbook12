  <title>Life Happens - Caroline Reber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They were like sisters, until everything changed one summer night. Fourteen years later, they find themselves living in different countries with no communication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Anna has landed her dream job and is living a fast-paced life in Dublin, Ireland. When she&#39;s diagnosed with a serious disease, she is forced to take on the biggest challenge she has ever encountered. Mia has found the love of her life and is living a glamorous life in Vienna, Austria when she finds out what happened to her old friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Circumstances bring the two women together again, but is it too late for them to rebuild what they had? What really happened all those years ago? Together they embark on a journey to confront their pasts, and on the way they acquire life-changing insight and new perspectives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Life Happens&lt;/i&gt; is a touching story about friendship, career, and the biggest question of them all-why do so many of us avoid change until faced with hardship?" />
