  <title>In Its Time - Nancy Rehkugler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As she mourns her mothers death, Delores Williams wonders how her life will change. After the funeral, she uncovers a mysterious collection in a safe deposit boxa collection of papers and old photographs that raise questions about her past. What secrets did her mother take to the grave? &lt;br /&gt;Soon after, Delores attends an art exhibit at the Everson Museum in Syracuse. In the gallery, Delores pores over artifacts that were removed from the attic of the Willard Psychiatric Center. Here, the lives of past patients are on displaysand Del is shocked to see a familiar face in one of the portraits. &lt;br /&gt;In her confusion, as she attempts to determine what to do next, she stumbles into a church service. There, she meets Eli Fisher, a pastor who offers help as she attempts to unravel her past. As her investigation begins to consume her life, Delores follows the tenuous trail of clues from Syracuse to the Mississippi Delta and, eventually, to Italy. &lt;br /&gt;Her journey will help to reveal the shadowy truth that connects four generations of women, each of whom dealt with trauma, abuse, and uncertainty in her own way. Can she find the strength to rise above her familys past to build a new legacy of hope, love, and redemption?&lt;/p&gt;" />
