Divorced, estranged from his only daughter, the retired life insurance salesman seeks only solitude and anonymity. Then Nathan finds his long-lost nephew, Tom Wood, working in a local bookstore--a far cry from the brilliant academic career he&#39;d begun when Nathan saw him last. Tom&#39;s boss is the charismatic Harry Brightman, whom fate has also brought to the &quot;ancient kingdom of Brooklyn, New York.&quot; Through Tom and Harry, Nathan&#39;s world gradually broadens to include a new set of acquaintances--not to mention a stray relative or two--and leads him to a reckoning with his past. &lt;br&gt;     Among the many twists in the delicious plot are a scam involving a forgery of the first page of &lt;i&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/i&gt;, a disturbing revelation that takes place in a sperm bank, and an impossible, utopian dream of a rural refuge. Meanwhile, the wry and acerbic Nathan has undertaken something he calls &lt;i&gt;The Book of Human Folly&lt;/i&gt;, in which he proposes &quot;to set down in the simplest, clearest language possible an account of every blunder, every pratfall, every embarrassment, every idiocy, every foible, and every inane act I had committed during my long and checkered career as a man.&quot; But life takes over instead, and Nathan&#39;s despair is swept away as he finds himself more and more implicated in the joys and sorrows of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;     The Brooklyn Follies&lt;/i&gt; is Paul Auster&#39;s warmest, most exuberant novel, a moving and unforgettable hymn to the glories and mysteries of ordinary human life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
