  <title>The Havana Room - Colin Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Havana Room&lt;/i&gt; is the tale of a man from his fall from the heights of power and wealth in New York to the moment where he might well die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Wyeth is a successful real-estate attorney in his late thirties with a wife and son, who, by the merest chance, loses everything: family, job, status. Unmoored and alone, Wyeth drifts toward the city&#39;s darker corners. Restoration seems unlikely, redemption impossible, when Wyeth finds himself in an old-time Manhattan steakhouse. He is intrigued by the manager, Allison Sparks--sexy, complicated, and independent in all ways. She also controls access to the restaurant&#39;s private bar. This is the Havana Room, and what goes on in there, he&#39;s told, is secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth agrees to help Alison&#39;s friend, Jay Rainey, in concluding a last-minute midnight real-estate transaction. As soon as he sees the players and the paperwork, Wyeth knows something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours, Wyeth finds himself tangled in Rainey&#39;s peculiar obsessions, which involve a Chilean businessman who feels he&#39;s been swindled, an old farmer frozen dead to a bulldozer, an outrageous black owner of a downtown hiphop club, and a fourteen-year-old English girl. Only Rainey knows the connections among these people, which are revealed when Wyeth is finally admitted to the Havana Room--where the survival of its inhabitants is most uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
