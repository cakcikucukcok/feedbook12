          &lt;strong&gt;He needed someone to bring a bit of life to the business! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mitch Hanover needed a miracle. And when Veronica Bing roared up in her pink Corvette, waltzed in wearing skinny jeans and high boots and told him she was the girl for the job – Mitch couldn’t help but agree! Mitch was gorgeous, but Veronica had learned the hard way that relationships at work were a bad idea. And Mitch had ‘BAD NEWS’ written across his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even if the attraction zinged between them, and his kisses made her melt, Mitch had lost his beloved wife – and sworn never to love again… Unless this sassy brunette could change his mind!&lt;/p&gt;
