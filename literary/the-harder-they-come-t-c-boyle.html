  <title>The Harder They Come - T.C. Boyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author T.C. Boyle makes his Ecco debut with a powerful, gripping novel that explores the roots of violence and anti-authoritarianism inherent in the American character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in contemporary Northern California, &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Come&lt;/em&gt; explores the volatile connections between three damaged people&amp;#8212;an aging ex-Marine and Vietnam veteran, his psychologically unstable son, and the son&amp;#39;s paranoid, much older lover&amp;#8212;as they careen towards an explosive confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a vacation cruise to Central America with his wife, seventy-year-old Sten Stensen unflinchingly kills a gun-wielding robber menacing a busload of senior tourists. The reluctant hero is relieved to return home to Fort Bragg, California, after the ordeal&amp;#8212;only to find that his delusional son, Adam, has spiraled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam has become involved with Sara Hovarty Jennings, a hardened member of the Sovereign Citizens&amp;#8217; Movement, right-wing anarchists who refuse to acknowledge the laws and regulations of the state, considering them to be false and non-applicable. Adam&amp;#8217;s senior by some fifteen years, Sara becomes his protector and inamorata. As Adam&amp;#39;s mental state fractures, he becomes increasingly schizophrenic&amp;#8212;a breakdown that leads him to shoot two people in separate instances. On the run, he takes to the woods, spurring the biggest manhunt in California history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he explores a father&amp;#8217;s legacy of violence and his powerlessness in relating to his equally violent son, T. C. Boyle offers unparalleled psychological insights into the American psyche. Inspired by a true story, &lt;em&gt;The Harder They Come&lt;/em&gt; is a devastating and indelible novel from a modern master.&lt;/p&gt;" />
