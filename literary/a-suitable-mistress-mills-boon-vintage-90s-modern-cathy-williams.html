        &lt;p&gt;Dane Sutherland was rich, powerful and sinfully gorgeous. He had it all - but he wanted more! He wanted Suzanne… and she was equally determined not to fall into his arms, or his bed! Suzanne had a deep grudge against Dane&#39;s family and, besides, he was used to dating petite, elegant women who hung on his every word.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suzanne was too tall, too outspoken… . She had to convince Dane she wouldn&#39;t make a suitable mistress at all!&lt;/p&gt;
