  <title>Snow, Ashes - Alyson Hagy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adams breathed through the thick weave of his pulse. Hobbs. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Again. His return likely meant trouble. Care and trouble.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;The uneasy friendship between Fremont Adams and C. D. Hobbs worked best when both men had a job to do, when they could fall into the rhythm of hard labor. Neglected by his mother at an early age, Hobbs found his way into the Adams family. But everyone could tell he was always a bit &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt;. Fremont resigned himself &lt;br&gt;to watching out for Hobbs, who had the innocence and optimism that can come only from ignorance. After a grueling tour of duty in Korea, however, Adams and Hobbs return to the ranch marked in dangerous ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four parts--alternating between the Wyoming ranch and Korea--Alyson Hagy reveals the intricacies of a profound friendship between two very different men. &lt;i&gt;Snow, Ashes &lt;/i&gt;is a suspenseful, engaging exploration of survival and failure and of how the most vulnerable among us can have a wisdom beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
