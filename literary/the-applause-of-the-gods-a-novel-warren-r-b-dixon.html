  <title>The Applause of the Gods, a Novel - Warren R B Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story of Faustian bargains happened in Paris in the 1950s. Using any means necessary to get to the top with her talent, Kathleen Ingersoll reached the far edge of possibility as a classical pianist. With the higher music establishment in the background, her story is neither about music nor about Paris. It is about a woman and the cost of extreme ambition, about love and other dangers, and about time and the river.
Events on streets and in neighborhoods that were never in Paris are in this book the same way that Poes murders happened in the Rue Morgue. Persons who existed in the pastfor example, Josephine Bakerare images in a distorted mirror. The world in this book and the one we call real happen inches apart. Whether Kathleen Ingersolls bargains with an imaginary or true devil could actually have happened somewhere, sometime, the author leaves to his many coauthors, the readers. They necessarily will see the story as different from what the author saw in telling it." />
