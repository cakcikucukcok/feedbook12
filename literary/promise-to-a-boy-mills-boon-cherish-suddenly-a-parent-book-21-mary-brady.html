  <title>Promise to a Boy (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Suddenly a Parent, Book 21) - Mary Brady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The small Montana town of St. Adelbert was supposed to be a refuge for Abby Fairbanks and her young nephew, Kyle.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the well-dressed, far-too-good-looking stranger standing outside her front door could threaten all that. His name is Reed Maxwell, and he&#39;s looking for his missing brother - possibly the father of the boy Abby has sworn to protect. Abby refuses to believe Reed is the type who&#39;d take a child from his home and the people who love him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because Reed seems like a good man, who didn&#39;t come to destroy a family but to mend one. Maybe even to find one. But when events beyond their control threaten to come between them, will Reed walk away and take Kyle - and Abby&#39;s heart - with him?&lt;/p&gt;
