        &lt;p&gt;In this 12 book collection of bestselling romances back by popular demand there are scandalous office affairs, ruthless millionaires, royal secrets and seductive propositions…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Seduced by the Rebel&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE BIG BAD BOSS by Susan Stephens&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Heath Stamp is rich, arrogant and ready to raze his family estate to the ground – even though frosty Bronte Foster-Jenkins tries to stop him. But this irresistible bad boy will happily take her down with him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT A REBEL… by Anne Oliver&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Blake Everett drives back into town, Lissa Sanderson’s teenage crush is back with a vengeance, despite his scandalous reputation. When she finds out that the former navy officer isn’t immune to her either – Lissa knows just what to do!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE SOCIALITE AND THE CATTLE KING by Lindsay Armstrong&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When their plane crashes in the middle of the Outback, prim and proper journalist Holly Harding is forced to rely on infamous billionaire Brett Wyndham for protection. How long can inexperienced Holly deny their sizzling attraction?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Tempting the Millionaire&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AN OFFICER AND A MILLIONAIRE by Maureen Child&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Navy SEAL Hunter Cabot had no patience with games. Margie had to go. She’d been pretending to be his wife and living in his house while he’d been overseas. Now all his skills were focused on payback: he’ll have his ‘wedding night’!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MARRYING THE MANHATTAN MILLIONAIRE by Jackie Braun&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When successful executive Samantha Bradford finds herself in a bidding war to land a huge account with ex-fiancé and business rival Michael Lewis, the stakes are high. But the real merger on the table is more than strictly business…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MYSTERIOUS MILLIONAIRE by Cassie Miles&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Liz Norton’s private investigations were run-of-the-mill – until she went undercover as a housekeeper. Forced to partner up with ruggedly handsome single dad Ben Crawford Liz yearns to drop the charade and show the millionaire exactly who she is.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal Seductions: Secrets &lt;/strong&gt; by Michelle Celmer&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE DUKE’S BOARDROOM AFFAIR&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gorgeous Duke Charles Frederick Mead made Victoria Houghton his PA when he took over her family business. He knows she despises him, but Charles has never met a woman he couldn’t seduce!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;ROYAL SEDUCER&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prince Christian would have wed whomever duty dictated, but Princess Melissa soon has the prince ready for a passionate royal wedding night. Now he just has to keep love out of the equation…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS WITH THE PRINCE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was just there to do a job… not fall in love! But Olivia Montgomery was having a difficult time remembering that when sexy Prince Aaron kept pursuing her. How could an ordinary woman hope to resist such a seduction?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Propositioned by the Playboy&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MISS MAPLE AND THE PLAYBOY by Cara Colter&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Primary-school teacher Beth Maple is cautious and conventional until she becomes besotted with stand-in dad Ben Anderson, who appears at the school gates. Being around him makes her feel truly alive. But Ben is dangerously out of her league!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE PLAYBOY DOCTOR’S MARRIAGE PROPOSAL by Fiona Lowe&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Emily Tippett is not what doctor Linton Gregory needs. An expert at protecting his own heart, he prefers to date and move on. But Linton has seen the beauty Emily is trying to hide. He’s ready to go from playboy doctor to husband-to-be, but is Emily interested?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE NEW GIRL IN TOWN by Brenda Harlen&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Photographer Zoe Kozlowski is transforming her new home into a bed and breakfast. Luckily for her, architect – and eligible bachelor – Mason Sullivan is there to help. Except Mason’s interests are more than just professional…&lt;/p&gt;
