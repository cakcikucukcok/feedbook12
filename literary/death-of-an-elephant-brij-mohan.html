  <title>Death of an Elephant - Brij Mohan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Death of an Elephant is an allegory of existence. Pran Dubey, a professor failed by avowed social institutions, is a conflicted man torn apart by his strife and Diaspora neurosis in the ambiguities of past and present, tradition and modernity, and life and death. Human incompleteness and lifes absurditieshope and despair trapped in the paradox of pain and pleasureare dramatized through an Eastern soul with a Western mind and a pen dipped in the ink of reflecti ve reality. &lt;i&gt;Death of an Elephant&lt;/i&gt; is a harbinger of the neo existential genre.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Brij Mohan entices the curiosity of his book with the piquant title, Death of an Elephant....[It] is really boundless in scope and meaning and of having significance for all who read it....Mohan plumbs the lives of his characters beyond the academic dimensions. They are  human beings caught in the web of life and who struggle to extricate themselves with honor from their problems.&lt;/P&gt;
- Joseph V. Ricapito
&lt;P&gt;I only exist, but I want to live...I was back where I began: A basterdized Shangri-La in search of a lost identi ty...You can run away from your past but the past will never run away from you.... The man in gray flannel suit has disappeared from our comity.... I wasnt born an American; I became one. I love history.... I love truth even more.... Academia, by and large, looks like a gigantic machine designed to commoditize education for unprincipled success.&lt;/P&gt;" />
