  <title>The Man Who Walked on Water - Jacob Beaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A trip to Appalachia to investigate a religious &quot;miracle&quot; becomes a transformational spiritual journey for one unsuspecting Londoner in this modern tale that touches on the mysterious questions in our lives&amp;#8212;a poignant, wry novel infused with the humor and warm skepticism of Nick Hornby&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;How to Be Good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumped, depressed, and bored with his dead-end job, Londoner John Mallory decides to shake up his life. He accepts his journalist brother&amp;#8217;s offer to help him on a documentary film investigating a pastor in rural Tennessee who claims he can walk on water. Locals are convinced it&amp;#8217;s the Lord&amp;#8217;s work. John and his brother, Steve, have their doubts, and hope the film will answer the question: Is it a true miracle&amp;#8212;or a giant hoax?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When John arrives in Appalachia, he discovers a few unexpected surprises, including a charming hotel receptionist who catches his eye and the charismatic, deeply religious pastor who coyly dodges the fact-focused investigation. The deeper John becomes immersed in this charming bucolic community that is so different from the harried, cold London he knows, the further conflicted he becomes. At a spiritual crossroads, John must decide what he wants: to force a decent man to prove his faith and return to an empty urban life&amp;#8212;or to explore the possibilities this new world of mystery, warmth, and faith-focused life holds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Beaver&amp;#8217;s beautiful and witty novel challenges the assumptions and certainties of a logic-driven, mainstream urban culture, offering an inviting alternative perspective that is open to mystery and new beginnings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Beaver writes well with very vivid descriptions of people, places, and states of mind. Unexpected, strangely satisfying, and great fun!&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;Lisa Alther, author of &lt;em&gt;About Women: Conversations Between a Writer and a Painter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kinflicks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The Man Who Walked on Water&lt;/em&gt; is a gentle, curious, attentive, and intelligent book. Jacob Beaver sees Southern Appalachia through fresh eyes, and he&amp;#8217;s got a wonderfully straightforward approach to the old problem of being a hurt person in a beautiful world. I loved it.&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;James Whorton, author of &lt;em&gt;Frankland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
