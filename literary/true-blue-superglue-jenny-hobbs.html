  <title>True Blue Superglue - Jenny Hobbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the fifties it was important to please your man. As the twentieth century wore on, it became more important to please yourself ... Anne Perceval thinks she has it all: the dreamboat husband, children, a happy household, and the ideal job. For the twenty-nine years of their marriage Doug is her safety net as she becomes a successful lifestyle journalist and agony aunt in London, writing popular columns for a women&#39;s magazine. But as Doug&#39;s career falters and a return home to South Africa holds an uncertain future, Anne faces new challenges that will test her resolve. When Doug falls ill, the consequences threaten everything she believes and has lived for. True Blue Superglue follows their lives from big-dreaming students to strung-out parents to a couple at the end of their tether. It is a love story with a sting in its tale that moves from South Africa to swinging London and back home again. Witty and poignant, Jenny Hobbs&#39;s novel is also a tribute to a life lived as a woman in changing times." />
