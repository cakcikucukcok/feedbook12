  <title>I Love You, Goodbye - Cynthia Rogerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Rogerson is a master of fresh and sparky writing… a spirited novel by a writer of considerable gifts&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE GUARDIAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dramatised on BBC Radio 4&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Woman&#39;s Hour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted for Creative Scotland Book of the Year Award 2010&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ana thinks she understands love. As a marriage counsellor she deals with the death of love every day. But when a new man unexpectedly enters her life, she finds that, for the first time ever, her heart is ruling her head and her strict rules of love are no longer so easy to apply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose is at her wits end with her husband Harry. Their familiar, frustrating marriage is reaching crisis point. Should Rose stick to what she knows or find a new way to live her life - without Harry - and try to find the happiness she craves?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Maciek, philosopher turned pizza-maker, has left home to escape a messy love affair. But as his feelings for someone new begin to grow, little does he realise how much his life is about to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love often happens when you least expect it. It&#39;s just like that in Evanton, a small Highland village, just like everywhere else. In this funny, profound and engaging story, seperate lives begin to inextricably intertwine and change forever as each tries to answer the universal question: what is love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;REVIEWS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Captured me from the first... a hugely accomplished novel.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOUISE WELSH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Rogerson’s prose is impressive and deceptively powerful, making this a subtle and insightful read.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE BIG ISSUE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;A great read... it’s sexy, funny, full of laconic and tender insights into the wonderful mess that people make of their relationships, and into that elusive prey we call love.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;TIM PEARS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;A good writer, who thinks properly about the world.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SCOTSMAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What is love? Love is the relationship that will develop between you and this quirky, wise, and fascinating novel. Your heart will pang with recognition again &amp;amp; again as Rogerson explores the foibles that make relationships so beautiful and so heartbreaking. An engaging, insightful and witty novel that resonates with a profound emotional intelligence.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;KEVIN MacNEIL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Her style is easy and graceful, but her spiky humour takes most of the honours in this tale of kiss and don’t tell.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;SCOTTISH REVIEW OF BOOKS&lt;/p&gt;" />
