  <title>My Before and After Life - Risa Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;A story of the sometimes prickly relationship between adult children and their parents &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;In Risa Miller&#39;s new novel, the first since the highly-acclaimed &lt;I&gt;Welcome to Heavenly Heights&lt;/I&gt;--one family member tries on a faith that seems like a bad fit for the rest. Honey and Susan, two sisters in Boston, are shocked to learn that their elderly father has embraced Orthodox Judaism while on vacation in the Holy Land. His daughters fly to Israel to convince him to return, but when they get there they find it hard to communicate their concerns as he tries to educate them on the finer points of religious life. Honey feels abandoned and angry. But the anger turns into an emotion she can&#39;t quite identify or accept during the course of the trip. And while she is still enraged, it becomes increasingly difficult for Honey to figure out exactly why she has condemned her father&#39;s choice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
