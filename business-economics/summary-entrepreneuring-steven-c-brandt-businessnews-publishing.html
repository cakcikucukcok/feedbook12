  <title>Summary: Entrepreneuring - Steven C. Brandt - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “ENTREPRENEURING: The Ten Commandments for Building a Growth Company” by Steven C. Brandt. The historical model for entrepreneurial success has been to start a business from scratch or with borrowed money, build it up and then sell out for a vast fortune. Today, however, some of the world’s most successful business founders stay with their companies well past the start-up stage. For these founders, the establishment of a thriving business which continues to innovate and grow year by year is more important than selling out. In Entrepreneuring, Steven C. Brandt exposes the 10 commandments for building a growth business. These commandments are based on the experiences of real-world companies which have been built from the ground up into the medium- and large-sized operations of today. The historical call of the classical entrepreneur was once, &quot;Be your own boss&quot;. The motivation of today’s entrepreneur is now more often, &quot;Let’s build something new of value&quot;. As Steven C. Brandt demonstrates in this compelling book, entrepreneuring is a way of life.Filled with practical advice and vital principles, Entrepreneuring is an essential read for ambitious entrepreneurs." />
