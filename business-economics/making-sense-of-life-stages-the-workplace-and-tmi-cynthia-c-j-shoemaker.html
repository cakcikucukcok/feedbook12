  <title>Making Sense of Life Stages, the Workplace and Tmi - Cynthia C. J. Shoemaker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book offers a model for making sense of the Information Age and too much information in the workplace and in life stages. The Sensemaking Flow Charts for handling Too Much Information and selecting alternatives are a sorting-out approach that has been used in corporations and can also be applied to government agencies and military services seeking to better use information technology to find innovative approaches for problems and for new definitions of problems.
	Popular author Thomas Friedman states that something big has happened in the worlds wiring in the last ten years, but it was obscured by the financial crisis and 9/11.  We went from a connected world to a hyperconnected world. He stated that Facebook, Twitter, 4G-5G,  Smart Phones, iPads, ubiquitous wireless and the cloud, big data, cellphone apps and Skype did not exist or were in their infancy a decade ago (in Forbes, May 2013). Making Sense of this and more is ones 21st Century task. 
 Hopefully overtime, some of the dilemmas and chaos discussed in the corporate, government and Defense Department chapters here will have been addressed and resolved. Looking back in hindsight allows one to see possibilities that presented themselves, even more clearly. 
	Applying the Making Sense Flow Chart to various known and difficult stages in the growing to adulthood years also was helpful to parents and to older children in the transition stages appearing in child and young adult development.  The charts for the transition age stages in todays world with information overload appear at the beginning of each chapter. The response to each chart by readers has been This has been very helpful." />
