  <title>Championship Habits - Adolph Brown Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most employees are educated and trained with the technical or hard skills necessary to perform their professions, but important componentssoft skillsare often lacking. These skills represent a cluster of personal qualities, habits, attitudes, and social graces that make a person a good employee and a compatible coworker. &lt;p&gt; 
Developed for organizations that deal with customers face-to-face, &lt;i&gt;Championship Habits&lt;/i&gt; outlines twenty core soft skills that author and successful entrepreneur Adolph Brown believes are the cornerstones of a successful business. Based on years of personal experience and research, he identified these core soft skills, or championship habits, which employees should possess. Some of them include:&lt;p&gt; 
 Strong work ethic&lt;br&gt; 
 Sociability&lt;br&gt; 
 Self-esteem&lt;br&gt; 
 Confidence&lt;br&gt; 
 Positive attitude&lt;br&gt; 
 Self-management&lt;br&gt; 
 Listening skills&lt;br&gt; 
 Social skills&lt;p&gt; 
By translating cutting-edge theory into concise, hip language with lasting and emotional impact and including a host of illustrative examples, &lt;i&gt;Championship Habits&lt;/i&gt; describes the importance of these twenty core personal qualities and interpersonal traits in a business environment. He shows how incorporating these championship habits at every turn will ensure that the workplace and the work itself are rewarding, profitable, and gratifying." />
