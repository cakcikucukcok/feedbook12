  <title>Mission Critical - Michael Abrams, Julia Taylor Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Center for Talent Innovation&#39;s new study, &lt;I&gt;Mission Critical: Unlocking the Value of Veterans in the Workforce&lt;/I&gt;, reveals how companies can ensure their veteran talent thrives in the corporate world. Veterans represent a highly desirable talent pool when they transition to civilian careers. They retain the passion for service and camaraderie that drew them into the military, and they bring leadership and technical skills honed in a pressure cooker. In recent years, corporate employers have demonstrated they understand the potential of this valuable cohort by greatly increasing their recruitment efforts. Yet once veterans get through the doors of corporations, they languish. In a matter of months many ambitious, skilled veterans lose their drive, failing to fulfill their leadership potential&amp;#151;more than half say they don&#39;t aspire to hold a more senior position. Many of the remainder feel stalled in their careers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Why? First, leaders don&amp;#8217;t understand their potential. Second, veterans feel distant from their teams and cover their veteran identity in an effort to get closer. Third, they hunger for meaning and purpose at work, something they found in the military but lack in civilian jobs. &lt;I&gt;Mission Critical&lt;/I&gt; explores these factors in-depth, especially as they affect women and veterans of color, and offers solutions to companies intent on keeping their veteran talent from tuning out and stalling out.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
