  <title>It’S Business, It’S Personal - Saad Amanullah Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its Business, Its Personal is an appropriate reminder that building a successful and sustainable business depends on many interdependent factors, not just one latest flavor of the month practice. Saad also reminds us of the vital importance of foundational values and principles guiding an organization. The book goes beyond the theory of business success but also provides very practical how to guidance. 
Werner Geissler, Vice Chairman of Global Operations,
Procter &amp; Gamble 
Mr. Saad brilliantly demonstrates the need for consumer-centric purpose as a basis for enduring business success. Equally important is his conviction that good organizational practice is rooted in a strong value system. Equipped with twenty-five years of hard-earned business experience at Procter &amp; Gamble, the author goes beyond lofty principles and provides time-honored advice on how to turn a vision into a winning in-market execution. 
Peter Corijn, Vice President for the Regional Business Unit of Gillette,
Procter &amp; Gamble
I was proud to have worked with Saad and found him an effective leadera most honest and dependable associate. A person I would like to work with in any assignment. 
Fouad Kraytem, President Middle East Africa and General Export (MEAGE), 
Procter &amp; Gamble 
Saad has captured a treasure trove of insights from his long career at P&amp;G.  Insights that contributed to the outstanding success of the subsidiaries he was an important part of. It is almost criminal that non-P&amp;Gers are offered the opportunity to read and learn from this book!
Philippe Bovay, Vice President/General Manager ,
Procter &amp; Gamble Pakistan
Excellent synopsis of the entire business exercise of vision setting and its associated processes. Saad captures in tremendous detail the entire process and goes into great depth on how to drive organizational excellence without which the vision would be powerless. The key to executing this process with excellence is what I call BOF i.e. Brutal Obsession with Fundamentals.
