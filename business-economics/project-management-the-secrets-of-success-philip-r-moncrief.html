  <title>Project Management: the Secrets of Success - Philip R. Moncrief</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a broad subject and there have been many excellent books written on the subject.  Some are encyclopedic in content.  This book is not.  Project Managers have little free time and they dont generally spend it reading books on &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management.  Project Management  The Secrets of Success&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a book of important topics and guidelines for the Project Manager - a book that can be read while traveling or referred to as an issue arises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is  THE critical skill in the engineering and construction world.  Most Presidents and senior managers of engineering and construction companies are former project managers.  Even in the Owner organizations, excellent project managers position themselves for senior management roles.  Why?  Because managing a project is fundamentally business management  starting, staffing, running and shutting down a business - excellent preparation for company management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; can be boiled down to 10 Project Management Commandments.  Following these ten commandments alone will not make a Project Manager successful; but, poor performance in any of these areas usually results in failure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1.	Safety  first, last and always&lt;br&gt;
2.	Contract  know it  follow it&lt;br&gt;
3.	Quality  good jobs have high quality&lt;br&gt;
4.	Schedule  no excuses&lt;br&gt;
5.	Basic Project Data  verify, then use&lt;br&gt;
6.	Be Completion Driven&lt;br&gt;
7.	Quantities  manage them&lt;br&gt;
8.	Money  guard it  ours or the Clients&lt;br&gt;
9.	Lead  clearly show the way&lt;br&gt;
10.	Client Relationship  you have the responsibility&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management  The Secrets of Success expands&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; each of these topics in detail. The book is not a primer on &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; it builds on  the knowledge of experienced Project Managers and provides them guidelines and coaching to improve project performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management  The Secrets of Success&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; also discusses the skills necessary to become an excellent Project manager.  They include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Leadership - giving proper direction and following progress on a detailed level.  &lt;br&gt;
	Insight  being able to understand the status and direction of a project from limited data  relying on experience and intuition to root out problems.&lt;br&gt;
	Consensus building - seeking alignment from your team and with your Client.  Getting all needed input before making decisions.&lt;br&gt;
	Communication skills including oral reporting, written communications and presentation skills.&lt;br&gt;
	Building excellent Client relationships.&lt;br&gt;
	Project risk -  how to recognize it and how to mitigate it.&lt;br&gt;
	How to keep a project on schedule.&lt;br&gt;
	Project costs -  understanding them in detail and monitoring and correcting poor cost performance.&lt;br&gt;
	Knowledge of contracts - what the key issues are and how to roll down the prime contract terms to subcontractors and vendors.&lt;br&gt;
	Understanding construction and being able to drive engineering, design and procurement to support the field.&lt;br&gt;
	Knowing and championing Safety - in design and in execution.&lt;br&gt;
	Being an outspoken advocate for Quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every experienced Project Manager will benefit from the lessons of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Management - The Secrets of Success.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
