I came to Mary Baker at a time when my business was in a slump and a lot of things in my life was
not going the way I wanted them to. I tried to change my business on my own, but was unable
to change it, it was going downhill. I WAS STRESSED OVER MY BUSINESS AND MY FAMILY
RELATIONSHIPS WERE SUFFERING. My friend recommended Ms. Baker to me and that was the
best thing that could have happened to me. Mary Baker not only help me turn my business around
by making a profi t, she also help me understand how to keep my business on top without working
harder. Thank you Mary Baker.
