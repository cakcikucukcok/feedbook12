  <title>Summary: Customer Mania - Ken Blanchard, Jim Ballard and Fred Finch - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “Customer Mania : It’s Never Too Late to Build a Customer-Focused Company by Ken Blanchard, Jim Ballard and Fred Finch.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To succeed in business today, you have to provide consistently great customer service. In other words, unless you have a unified, people-first, customer-oriented culture, it will be difficult to build your business going forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, any company large or small can achieve this. Note that you can’t build a customer-focused company by emphasizing the results that you want to achieve. This is the equivalent of putting the cart before the horse. When you focus on results, getting people to do the right thing will be an effort – people will have to be convinced that’s the right way to go. A much more effective idea is to concentrate on building your people first, and then they will just naturally take care of the customer in the ways you prefer. Get your people acting with passion and commitment and everything else will just naturally fall into place. With astute management, you’ll even be able to create a self-perpetuating cycle where the work feeds the energy of the people involved, which in turn means the work gets done better, leading to increased levels of energy in the future and so on." />
