      <meta name="description" content="Plan B:
5 Differences That Make a Difference in Your Home Business
You cant ask for what you want unless you know what it is. A lot of people dont know what they want, or they want much less than they deserve. First you have to figure out what you want. Second, you have to decide that you deserve it. Third, you have to believe you can get it. And, fourth, you have to have the guts to ask for it.
Barbara de Angelis
Having a Plan B to protect yourself, while providing more overall security in your life, is critical in times of change and uncertainty. The objective of this chapter is to explore a shift in thinking and action, moving away from being stuck in a full-time job and a part-time life to having a full-time life and a part-time jobliving life on your own terms. Having a Plan B fundamentally means having your own home-based business to generate cash flow.
In the e-book titled Plan B, I share with you what has worked for me, putting the lessons learned along my journey of trial and error into a clear format that you can use to create your own Plan B. Each chapter targets a particular area in which positive changes must be made:
1.	The Differences That Make a Difference helps you to identify the key risk and reward activities responsible for creating multiple, exponential resultsnot just incremental gains.
2.	Success vs. Struggle explores your mind-set and examines what subconscious thought patterns may have created obstacles for you in achieving your goals.
3.	Focus and Flow moves you through a succession of concepts, each one building on the previous one to create a stronger foundation.
4.	Aligning Opportunities and Goals takes these two elements, which are often considered separately, and integrates them to help you achieve better results.
5.	Action Steps for Geometric Gains provides hands-on exercises to propel you toward your goal and dreams. It examines your daily method of operation, income-producing activities, and sales and marketing plan.
The benefits of a home-based business are undeniable for those who choose this course. They include flexible working hours, no commuting hassles, more personal or family time, and the likelihood of financial freedom, which all fulfill living life with passion.
However, for those caught up in working-hard routines and not manifesting their truly desired results, the entrepreneurial dream of self-actualization can quickly vanish. In the face of these challenges, its easy to retreat into your comfort zone while grabbing hold of excuses such as the economy is bad or maybe next month or next year. But remember that though you could retreat into your comfort zone because it feels more secure and familiar, doing so is ultimately unfulfilling and stressful (and sometimes boring).
Hard work is not the only important ingredient to creating your success. Whether in your career or in your own business, knowing and applying the Plan B strategies will enable you to realize better lifelong resultsif you give yourself permission to do so.
Ive worked with many entrepreneurs and have faced the challenges of self-employment myself. As Ive watched people struggle, a number of key questions came up over and over:
	Why do they work such long hours every day, every week, without gaining results?
	Why do they repeatedly attend workshops without achieving their true goals?
	Why do they get fired up applying what they have learned only to attain the same unsatisfactory results?
The answers to these mysteries lie in the mind.
Your mind is the most powerful tool at your disposal. Some call it your blueprint. Subconscious thought patterns and beliefs can sabotage your best conscious efforts toward success. Its what happens on the inside that determines what happens on the outside, and grasping this truth is key to unlocking your potential, both personally and professionally.
