  <title>No More Work - James Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For centuries we&#39;ve believed that work was where you learned discipline, initiative, honesty, self-reliance--in a word, character. A job was also, and not incidentally, the source of your income: if you didn&#39;t work, you didn&#39;t eat, or else you were stealing from someone. If only you worked hard, you could earn your way and maybe even make something of yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent decades, through everyday experience, these beliefs have proven spectacularly false. In this book, James Livingston explains how and why Americans still cling to work as a solution rather than a problem--why it is that both liberals and conservatives announce that &quot;full employment&quot; is their goal when job creation is no longer a feasible solution for any problem, moral or economic. The result is a witty, stirring denunciation of the ways we think about why we labor, exhorting us to imagine a new way of finding meaning, character, and sustenance beyond our workaday world--and showing us that we can afford to leave that world behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
