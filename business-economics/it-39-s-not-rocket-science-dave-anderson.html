  <title>It&#39;s Not Rocket Science - Dave Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Stop chasing hot trends and start driving real growth&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s Not Rocket Science&lt;/i&gt; blasts through the trends and false promises permeating the business world to help you and your company get back to basics and get things done. Why doggedly pursue the &quot;next big thing&quot; when the most effective drivers of growth are right under your nose? This book asserts that you&#39;ve already heard, been taught, and know well the key fundamentals that spell business success, and presents a compelling, four strategy blueprint for returning your business culture and strategies to a rock solid foundation of execution excellence. Each chapter opens with &lt;i&gt;The Challenge&lt;/i&gt;, which outlines a current condition that exists due to a departure from common sense behaviors, and tasks you with following the appropriate execution principles to get your business on the right track. After a thorough explanation of &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why,&quot; each chapter gives you the actionable &quot;how&quot; so you can implement these valuable steps and master the art of execution in your organization. &lt;p&gt;Shifting sands do not make for a sustainable structure. If your organization is to be robust and strong enough to weather any storm, the strength must come from the very core; the ability for each member of your team to execute daily and effectively towards your organization&#39;s most compelling goals. Frankly, the last things most organizations need is another goal they&#39;ll miss because they can&#39;t execute well. This book reminds you of the four timeless execution methods and strategies that have proven themselves over centuries, and shows you how they are implemented in today&#39;s business environment. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get the leaders right&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get the culture right&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get the people right&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get the process right&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s flash in the pan may be superficially intriguing, but is it really that much different from yesterday&#39;s &quot;hot tip&quot;? Fundamentals are fundamental for a reason, and &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s Not Rocket Science&lt;/i&gt; is the common sense guide to putting away flavor-of-the-month toys and getting down to business." />
