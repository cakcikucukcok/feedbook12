      <meta name="description" content="&quot;David  hated confrontation.  He had  not handled  it well in the past. If he was  honest with himself, he had to admit that although he was well-regarded by his staff  as a  person, they also thought  he was  a  pushover. He knew he had to talk to Tom, but  he lacked the confidence,  the know-how and the  resolve to do it ... He was scared and he hated himself for  it. Hefelt sick.&quot;  Confronting poor behaviour can be one of the most difficult tasks a manager has to face. In a revealing conversation with his daughter, David learns a powerful lesson that allows him to overcome his fear of confrontation and become a more productive manager.  Why do you frown, Daddy? tackles head on one of the major issues that supervisors and managers face every day. The book&#39;s series of practical and easy-to-follow strategies gives the confidence needed to effectively deal with unacceptable behaviour in the workplace.  &quot;Breathtaking in its ease and simplicity, Mr  Whitecross sets out the problem and then solves it with such clarity one wonders why the rest of us  have been so puzzled for so long.&quot;  - David Miller, Legal Counsel - Workplace Relations, Australian Industry Group" />
