  <title>Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader - Herminia Ibarra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;You aspire to lead with greater impact.&lt;/B&gt; The problem is you&amp;#8217;re busy executing on today&amp;#8217;s demands. You know you have to carve out time from your day job to build your leadership skills, but it&amp;#8217;s easy to let immediate problems and old mind-sets get in the way. Herminia Ibarra&amp;#151;an expert on professional leadership and development and a renowned professor at INSEAD, a leading international business school&amp;#151;shows how managers and executives at all levels can step up to leadership by making small but crucial changes in their jobs, their networks, and themselves. In &lt;I&gt;Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader&lt;/I&gt;, she offers advice to help you:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149;  Redefine your job in order to make more strategic contributions&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149;  Diversify your network so that you connect to, and learn from, a bigger range of stakeholders&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#149;  Become more playful with your self-concept, allowing your familiar&amp;#151;and possibly outdated&amp;#151;leadership style to evolve&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ibarra turns the usual &amp;#147;think first and &lt;I&gt;then&lt;/I&gt; act&amp;#8221; philosophy on its head by arguing that doing these three things will help you learn through action and will increase what she calls your &lt;I&gt;outsight&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#151;the valuable external perspective you gain from direct experiences and experimentation. As opposed to insight, outsight will then help change the way you think as a leader: about what kind of work is important; how you should invest your time; why and which relationships matter in informing and supporting your leadership; and, ultimately, who you want to become.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Packed with self-assessments and practical advice to help define your most pressing leadership challenges, this book will help you devise a plan of action to become a better leader and move your career to the next level. It&amp;#8217;s time to learn by doing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
