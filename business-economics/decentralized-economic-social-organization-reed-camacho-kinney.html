  <title>Decentralized Economic Social Organization - Reed Camacho Kinney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Representational government is not authentic democracy. The American Constitution cannot defend us from socioeconomic domination by centralized power. Independence means that people organize among themselves in order to meet all of their existential needs, which include more than preserving corporal survival. It means actualizing a better civil and civic organization, and adding to that a &lt;em&gt;civic-economic&lt;/em&gt; organization (explained in my other writings) in order to afford every child the support needed to grow as &lt;em&gt;individuated&lt;/em&gt; people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genius my father contributed is the means of making consensus-based decision making processes a structured organization in conjunction with mutual banking, and its production-based economy, which as an organization &lt;em&gt;must &lt;/em&gt;expand, or perish. That inbuilt expansive component is what distinguishes DESO from all other attempts to create a better lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By forcing decentralization to expand, as a structural component, consequent of consensus-based organization and its mutual banking, and its production-based economy, it will compete with mass centrist society for members, because living in real, sovereign community provides a better quality of life; a better culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am encouraged that there are people really interested in making this project move into its actualization, and that eventuality is nearing.&lt;/p&gt;
