Is a fully trained team formed, supported, and committed to work on the Response Management improvements?  Is the Response Management organization completing tasks effectively and efficiently?  What would be the goal or target for a Response Management&#39;s improvement team?  Who are the Response Management improvement team members, including Management Leads and Coaches?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a challenge or meet an objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY group, company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Response Management investments work better.
