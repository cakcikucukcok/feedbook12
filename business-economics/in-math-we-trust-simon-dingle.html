  <title>In Math We Trust - Simon Dingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A highly readable account of a complex subject, &lt;i&gt;In Math We Trust&lt;/i&gt; is all you need to find out about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, the future of money and the journey to being your own bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money is the most important human invention after language. It provides tokens for the faith we have in each other and society, but that trust has been violated repeatedly throughout history by the middlemen and authorities we rely upon in order to transact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a new kind of money promises to rescue us from these tyrants and return us to the roots of money, without relying on third-parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of putting our faith in banks and governments, we can trust math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Dingle has been working with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies since 2011, designing products that make it easier to engage with this new world of money. He is also a broadcaster, writer and speaker who makes complex subjects simple for his audiences. Having led the product team at one of the world’s first Bitcoin exchanges and on other popular fintech products, Simon continues to design and invest in projects that make money more fair, this in addition to his weekly radio show that helps people with technology more generally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book Simon looks at the evolution of human trust that not only explains how cryptocurrencies work and the origins of Bitcoin, but how you can use these networks to take control of your own financial universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
