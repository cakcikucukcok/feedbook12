  <title>Notes and Recollections: With The Historical Setting of the Austrian School of Economics - Ludwig Von Mises, Bettina Bien Greaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Published for the first time together in one volume is Ludwig von Mises&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Notes and Recollections &lt;/i&gt;with&lt;i&gt; The Historical Setting of the Austrian School of Economics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After Mises died, in 1973, Mrs. Margit von Mises found the German-language manuscript for &lt;i&gt;Notes and Recollections &lt;/i&gt;among his papers. It had been written between 1940 and 1941, shortly after he arrived in the United States. &lt;i&gt;Notes and Recollections &lt;/i&gt;could be described as MIses&#39;s pre-1940 intellectual autobiography; it tells how he developed his theories, wrote his books, lectured, and taught; it describes his life in Vienna and the people with whom he worked. This text includes a foreword by Mrs. Mises and a postscript by Hans Sennholz.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;Historical Setting&lt;/i&gt; is a 45-page essay originally published in English in 1969, and it also reveals Mises&#39;s intellectual development in the context of the origins of the Austrian School. It serves as a good introduction to the theory of the Austrian School as well as to its history.&lt;/div&gt;" />
