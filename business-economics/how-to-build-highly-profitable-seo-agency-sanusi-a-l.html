  <title>How to Build Highly Profitable SEO Agency - Sanusi A. L.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book teaches you step by step how to build a 7 figure SEO digital marketing company and land $5,000 clients even if you don&amp;#39;t Know anything about SEO (search engine optimization).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is written for beginners looking to learn SEO and create a passive 7 figure income from it monthly. I&amp;#39;ve been doing SEO marketing since 2014. Unfortunately, there are still millions of companies I&amp;#39;m yet to reach out to and help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My book will teach you how to build your own agency and start killing it with SEO. You will learn how to help big companies get free traffic from Google.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will also learn how to make money from the knowledge of SEO I provide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wrote this book to teach who ever is lucky to find it the basics and some advanced tactics of SEO needed to run a very profitable digital marketing agency. YOU are one of the lucky people who have found this precious book. So I strongly advise you to order it right away.&lt;br /&gt;
In the book, I go further to show how you can become an SEO Pro quickly and make the kind of money you never dream possible in the digital marketing industry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sky is the beginning when it comes to making money from SEO marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
In this book I&amp;#39;ll show you:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Where you can find businesses with large budgets and who are in desperate need of help (my new 2018 special SEO tactic).&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; The 10 best niches around which I would build an SEO agency. I revisited the predictions I made in 2017 to show how accurate I was.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; The list of exact companies you should offer to help.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; How to speed up your success with the model of SEO that I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More specifically, here&amp;#39;s what you will learn in my book:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; 10 niches you&amp;#39;ve likely never thought of before that are going to explode in popularity.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; How I find companies to reach out to, companies that need SEO help and are willing to pay you at least 5 thousand dollars for it very quickly and do not mess around.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Actual companies I would personally reach out to and offer to help, and how I&amp;#39;d offer to help them.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Where to watch a video of my live case study where I wrapped up new clients with a pen name with a brand new website.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Where to have me personally share the SEO leads I get with you (I literally had hundreds in August 2018 alone).&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Share with you the niche I get the most client inquiries in &amp;ndash; you will be as surprised as I am.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are 7 good reasons why you should start your own SEO agency:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #1: The SEO industry is growing very fast&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #2: SEO is the 8th most-in-demand Linkedin skill&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #3: Getting SEO clients is an introvert&amp;#39;s dream (you don&amp;#39;t need to talk to anyone if you don&amp;#39;t want to)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #4: There&amp;#39;s an unlimited supply of clients. 170,000 new websites are built every single day.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #5: Your income can be totally passive&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #6: Your language and location are irrelevant.You can speak any anguage and work from anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; #7: Ad Bans creates a great opportunity. Some companies which have been banned by Google and Facebook from running paid ads have no other option than to turn to SEO to get traffic. I will tell you who they are in my book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what are you waiting for? Order this book right now to learn how to start your own SEO marketing agency because I&amp;#39;ve made SEO marketing really very simple to understand.&lt;br /&gt;
