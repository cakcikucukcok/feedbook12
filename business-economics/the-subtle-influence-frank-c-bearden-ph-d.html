  <title>The Subtle Influence - Frank C. Bearden Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Subtle Influence: Conflicts of Interest in Financial Planning&lt;/i&gt; by Frank C. Bearden, Ph. D. is a book that will change your financial advising practice. It will ease your mind, lower your level of stress and better prepare you for
whatever the regulators choose to impose on financial advisors. You will be a better, more confident advisor.&lt;p&gt;
This book should be read and absorbed by all advisors, RIAs, Registered Representatives, Broker/Dealers and all of those charged with providing unconflicted advice and professional judgment. It brings the sometimes elusive concept of fiduciary into something to which we all can strive.&lt;p&gt;
Ben G. Baldwin, CFP, ChFC, CLU, MSM, MSFS Noted Author, Speaker, Educator&lt;p&gt;
Through detailed case studies, you will determine how to evaluate and respond to conflicts of interest so that your integrity is never called into question. Discover practical solutions that you can implement right away.&lt;p&gt;
Conflicts of interest continue to wreck the careers of many professionals, and they also contributed to the recent financial crisis that devastated so many individuals and companies. Ensure that you survive and succeed with &lt;i&gt;The Subtle Influence: Conflicts of Interest in Financial Planning&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
Conflicts of interest are a core component of discussions regarding client-planner
relationships and fiduciary responsibility in the financial services industry. Dr. Bearden discusses such conflicts in a clear, straightforward manner, and his usage of client scenarios effectively adds color to ethical
gray areas. Dr. Beardens book is required reading for those advisors who aspire to maintain long-lasting client relationships and who want to interact with clients in a transparent, ethical, and mutually productive manner.&lt;p&gt;
