  <title>Top Dog - Andy Bounds, Richard Ruttle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get the results you want and come out as the Top Dog in every conversation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Fancy being the ‘Top Dog’ in all your dealings? Fed up of feeling like the underdog? So many of us regularly ‘lose’ in conversations before we’ve even opened our mouths. Often without realising it, we don’t see ourselves as a peer of the other person. And we transmit this in what we do and say (“I’ll fit round you. I know you’re really busy.”) The other person picks up on this. And, without doing a thing, they’re suddenly in charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top Dog will teach you how to lead in all your interactions, so you can get more of what you want, more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, Andy Bounds and Richard Ruttle are experts at helping people achieve more from their conversations with others. Their techniques work in every type of interaction—conversations, socialising, dating, interviews, sales, marketing, and networking. Basically, anytime you want to impress and persuade others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top Dog:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Details the skill set needed to gain competitive advantage from the outset &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Provides instructive and thought-provoking content, relevant to both beginners, and seasoned professionals&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Contains insights from working with some of the world’s largest companies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Addresses how to achieve more from interactions in business and social arenas&lt;/p&gt;" />
