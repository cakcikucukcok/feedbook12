  <title>Managing Organizational Change - Linda C. Mattingly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Today’s business leaders are required to navigate a difficult path between building and maintaining a stable, effective and successful organization, and rolling out a seemingly endless series of complex change initiatives to ensure ongoing relevance in the marketplace. Complex change is costly, difficult, and has a high degree of risk.  By definition, complex change requires individuals within the organization to make significant changes in how they fulfill the duties associated with their role.  Things like moving to a new technology platform, going through a merger, organizational restructuring, and adding or eliminating a product or service all involve complex change. In 1990, Peter Senge’s book The Fifth Discipline was published, and the concept of organizational change management was introduced into the business world.  Since then, analysis of data from thousands of change implementations point to the same conclusion – approximately 70% of change projects fail to achieve their defined goals.  This data also shows that the 30% of projects that do meet expected ROI all found a way to effectively address the people side of change. This book introduces the concept of integrated organizational change methodology (iOCM™), which provides a framework for integrating best practice organizational change management principles into all facets of a change plan, resulting in significantly improved project outcomes and maximum return on investment." />
