  <title>Whispers of the Dead - Spencer Kope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A series of bizarre murders--the victims nearly unidentifiable--forces FBI tracker &quot;Steps&quot; Craig to match wits with the most cold-blooded killer he&#39;s ever encountered.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a murder, but not only is the identity of the victim unknown, most of the body itself is missing.  All that&#39;s been found is a pair of feet, stored in a portable cooler, and left in the house of a Federal judge in El Paso, Texas. The killer apparently broke into the judge&#39;s house, left his grizzly message, and disappeared without a trace.  With no clues as to the killer, the person killed, or the intent behind the cooler, all the authorities really know is that this likely isn&#39;t the killer&#39;s first--or his last--victim.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnus &quot;Steps&quot; Craig is an FBI agent and an elite tracker, easily the best in the world. Steps is renowned for his incredible ability to find and follow trails over any surface. As part of the three-man special team, FBI&#39;s Special Tracking Unit (STU), he is called in on cases where his skills are indispensable. But there&#39;s a secret to his skill. Steps has a kind of synesthesia, an ability that allows him to see whatever each particular person has touched in a unique color--what Steps calls &#39;shine.&#39; His ability is known to only a few people--his father, the director of the FBI, and his partner, Special Agent Jimmy Donovan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Special Tracking Unit tries to grapple with the gruesome scene in El Paso, they soon discover another, earlier victim. Once again, only the feet--in a disposable icebox--were left behind. With almost no clues besides the body parts, Steps and his team find themselves enmeshed in the most difficult case of their careers. And The Icebox Killer has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;" />
