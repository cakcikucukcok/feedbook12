  <title>The Cat Sitter&#39;s Cradle - John Clement, Blaize Clement</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blaize Clement won fans all over the world with the charm and wit of her pet-sitting mysteries. Now, with the help of her son, author John Clement, Blaize&#39;s beloved heroine Dixie Hemingway is back for yet another thrilling adventure in this critically-acclaimed series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixie has built a nice, quiet life for herself in the sleepy town of Siesta Key, a sandy resort island off the coast of Florida. In fact, her pet-sitting business is going so well she&#39;s even taken on part-time help: Kenny, a handsome young surfer who lives alone in a rickety old houseboat. But things get a little messy when, on an early morning walk in the park with a client&#39;s schnauzer, Dixie makes a shocking discovery. Hidden among the leafy brambles is a homeless girl, alone and afraid, cradling a newborn baby in her arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dixie takes the young girl under her wing, even though she&#39;s just been hired by Roy Harwick, the snarky executive of a multi-national oil company, to care for his equally snarky Siamese cat, Charlotte, along with his wife&#39;s priceless collection of rare, tropical fish. It&#39;s not long before Dixie stumbles upon a dead body in the unlikeliest of places, and soon she&#39;s set adrift in a murky and dangerous world in which no one is who they appear to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart, fast-paced and entertaining, The Cat Sitter&#39;s Cradle is a perfect illustration of why Dixie&#39;s loyal fans have come to know and love her and eagerly await the next installment of her adventures.&lt;/p&gt;" />
