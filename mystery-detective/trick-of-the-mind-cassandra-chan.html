  <title>Trick of the Mind - Cassandra Chan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trick of the Mind&lt;/i&gt;, Cassandra Chan&#39;s third clever outing for these best friends, written in the classic tradition with a delightfully modern voice all its own, is a charming story that mystery lovers are sure to enjoy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland Yard Detective Sergeant Jack Gibbons has been shot twice, and even after the surgery he isn&#39;t out of the woods and may still be in danger because he can&#39;t remember how it all happened. While his colleagues dig into his personal life, his best friend, Phillip Bethancourt, focuses on his last case, the robbery of a collection of antique jewelry valued at hundreds of thousands of pounds.    Although Phillip is a man of leisure---handsome, charismatic, and fantastically well off---he makes a point of tagging along on Jack&#39;s more interesting cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this time it&#39;s different. Not only is it personal, but Phillip will have to fill in the blanks without Jack, and retracing his friend&#39;s steps may put him in the same line of fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Chan pulls off an ending as surprising as it is fitting.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
