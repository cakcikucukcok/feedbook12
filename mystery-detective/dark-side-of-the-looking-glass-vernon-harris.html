  <title>Dark Side of the Looking Glass - Vernon Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sam Michael is having bad dreams; his sleep has been agitated and interrupted in the weeks leading up to his fiftieth birthday. On that day, however, tragedy strikes, and a freak accident leaves Sam in a comatose state. To the people who love him, he sleeps peacefully. For Sam, the state of unconsciousness is anything but restful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam is the victim of a relentless incubus. This monstrous creature forces Sams dreaming mind into a parallel universe. He may have fallen into a coma at the age of fifty in 1995, but his mind has been transported to Vietnam in 1965. Sam must now survive a horrific war he thought he once escaped; worse, in the dream, he is wounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to awaken and return home, Sam must complete an unknown mission. But the shock of being caught up in &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;war leaves him spinning, however, and he feels unable to finish his task. A journey must be taken, a place discovered, and a mystery solved. The ruthless incubus would keep Sam in its power forever, but Sams life is in his grasp, if only he can escape the war a second time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
