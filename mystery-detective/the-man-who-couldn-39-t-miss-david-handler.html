At last he&amp;#8217;s enjoying his own, very welcome second act. After hitting a creative slump following the success of his debut novel, Hoagy has found inspiration again. Ensconced with his faithful but cowardly basset hound, Lulu, on a Connecticut farm belonging to his ex-wife, Oscar-winning actress Merilee Nash, he&amp;#8217;s busy working on a new novel. He&amp;#8217;s even holding out hope that he and Merilee might get together again. Life is simple and fulfilling&amp;#8212;which of course means it&amp;#8217;s time for complications to set in&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the police call to ask if he knows the whereabouts of a man named R.J.

Her reputation, as well as the playhouse&amp;#8217;s future, is at stake. The cast features three of Merilee&amp;#8217;s equally famous Oscar-winning classmates from the Yale School of Drama.
