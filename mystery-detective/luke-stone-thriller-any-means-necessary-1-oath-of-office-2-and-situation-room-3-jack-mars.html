  <title>Luke Stone Thriller: Any Means Necessary (#1), Oath of Office (#2) and Situation Room (#3) - Jack Mars</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bundle of books #1(ANY MEANS NECESSARY), #2 (OATH OF OFFICE) and #3 (SITUATION ROOM) in Jack Mars&#39;s Luke Stone Thriller series-a bestseller with over 150 five star reviews! This bundle offers books one, two, and three in one convenient file, with over 250,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ANY MEANS NECESSARY, nuclear waste is stolen by jihadists in the middle of the night from an unguarded New York City hospital. The police, in a frantic race against time, call in the FBI. Luke Stone, head of an elite, secretive, department within the FBI, is the only man they can turn to. Luke realizes right away that the terrorists&#39; aim is to create a dirty bomb, that they seek a high-value target, and that they will hit it within 48 hours. A cat and mouse chase follows, pitting the world&#39;s most savvy government agents versus its most sophisticated terrorists. As Agent Stone peels back layer after layer, he soon realizes he is up against a vast conspiracy, and that the target is even more high value than he could have imagined-leading all the way to the President of the United States.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OATH OF OFFICE, a biological agent is stolen from a biocontainment lab. Weaponized, it could kill millions, and a desperate national hunt ensues to catch the terrorists before it is too late. Luke Stone, head of an elite FBI department, with his own family still in jeopardy, has vowed to walk away-but when the new President, barely sworn in, calls him, he can&#39;t turn his back on her.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SITUATION ROOM A cyberattack on an obscure U.S. dam leaves thousands dead and the government wondering who attacked it, and why. When they realize it is just the tip of the iceberg-and that the safety of all of America is at stake-the President has no choice but to call in Luke Stone. Head of an elite, disbanded FBI team, Luke does not want the job. But with new enemies-foreign and domestic-closing in on her from all sides, the President can only trust him. What follows is an action-packed international roller-coaster, as Luke learns that the terrorists are more sophisticated than anyone realizes, that the target is more extensive than anyone could image-and that there is very little time left to save America.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political thrillers with non-stop action, dramatic international settings, unexpected twists and heart-pounding suspense, the Luke Stone series is an explosive new series that will leave you turning pages late into the night. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book #4 in the series will be available soon." />
