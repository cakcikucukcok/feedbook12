  <title>The Witherspoon Legacy - G.K. Sutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amanda Childs, Attorney at Law, also moonlights as parish organist at St. Catherines Episcopal Church, Mainville.  A widow, she lost her husband Andrew, an FBI agent, four years ago when he was mysteriously killed.  The details of his death were never disclosed by the authorities.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amanda has never remarried.  Instead, Amanda has thrown herself into her law practice, as well as immersed herself in the musical and church activities in the small town of Mainville.  Her dear friend and constant companion is Marjorie Witherspoon, an older and wealthy woman who lost her husband and daughter, Amandas best friend, in an automobile accident fifteen years earlier.  Together they are active in church and community activities.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amandas friend Marjy succumbs in a valiant fight against cancer.  Amanda finds herself again alone and struggling with her grief and loneliness.  In the aftermath of Marjys death, Amanda discovers herself suddenly named in Marjories new will as trustee for several large projects on behalf of the church, and as residuary legatee, the estate being in excess of fifty million dollars.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The day of the memorial service, the Bishop, Stephen Marks, who is celebrating the Eucharist, is handed a letter from Marjorie Witherspoon, to whom he was engaged years ago.  He staggers out of church during the service, and suffers a heart attack.  Amanda finds him, and her intervention helps save his life.  Later at the wake Amanda becomes violently ill and passes out.  There are some rumblings in the community that she is actually a closet alcoholic and pill addict.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The day after the memorial service, Amanda is visited by an auditor from the Presiding Bishop, who is investigating unexplained disappearances of monies from the diocese and church, the vehicle seemingly through the recital series fund she and Marjorie had set up.  Suspicion turns to Amanda, as allegations are made that she has unduly influenced Marjorie Witherspoon in order to inherit, as well as that she has set up a corporation for the embezzlement of funds from the church.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amanda finds herself embroiled in possible scandal and criminal investigation, as Connor Thomson, the auditor retained by the Presiding Bishops office, continues to encounter and engage her in his search for evidence.  Her close childhood friend Bill Barnes, another attorney from an old established family in town, a perennial playboy and recent widower, reappears at her side, trying to seduce her into marriage.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amanda is faced with a dilemma of who to trust as she is mired in suspicion and the evidence of fraud points to her.  Mysterious incidents threaten her life and keep her on edge.  In the meantime she must fend off the accusations of Connor Thomson and the advances of Bill Barnes, while making arrangements to get away to New York to see Malachi Feinstein, the attorney handling Marjories estate, who urges her to meet with him without delay.  
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As Amanda is drawn more and more into danger, she is unaware that the small-town secrets regarding her and those she has loved, events about which she has been in the dark, are about to be revealed." />
