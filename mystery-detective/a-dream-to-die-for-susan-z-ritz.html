  <title>A Dream to Die For - Susan Z. Ritz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="•	The International Association for the Study of Dreams has held an annual conference for the past thirty-five years. The conferences are so extensive that they last for five days, with over 140 presenters and keynote speakers from more than twenty countries. 
•	Scientific and academic institutions, including the Neurological Laboratory in Frankfurt, the American Academy of Neurology, the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, and the University of California Berkeley, continue to put forth valuable resources to study dreams because understanding them remains so important to humans today. 
•	Dreams continue to fascinate the general public: USA Network’s &lt;em&gt;Falling Water&lt;/em&gt;; Adult Swim’s &lt;em&gt;Dream Corp, LLC&lt;/em&gt;; and Showtime’s &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; are just three examples of today’s successful TV series that focus on dreams and dream interpretation. Anyone who studies dreams or who is interested in the mystery and the science of dreams will be excited to read this book.
•	According to book sales reported by Simba Information, the top two most popular book genres generating big money are Romance/Erotica, closely followed by Crime/Mystery. The ‘criminal element’ pulls in upwards of $730 million a year in book sales.” (&lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;)
•	Virtual reality is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 2010s, and its popularity is continuing to grow. MediaKix explains, “In 2016, $3.7 billion in global revenue was generated from selling virtual reality software and hardware. By 2020, the virtual reality industry is predicted to generate a total revenue of more than $20 billion.” Furthermore, “A recent study examined U.S. virtual reality use and found that 22.4 million Americans experience virtual reality at least once a month. It’s predicted that by 2018, the number of U.S. virtual reality users will grow to 36.7 million, over a 60% increase in just one year.” &lt;em&gt;Stolen Dreams&lt;/em&gt; examines the ways virtual reality has impacted our lives and may continue to do so. Any users of virtual reality, or anyone curious about this popular new technology, will be interested in this book.
•	Cults are having a cultural moment. Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;The Path&lt;/em&gt; has seen huge success, as has Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Wild Wild Country&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about the 10,000 followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh who lived on a ranch in Oregon in the 1980s." />
