  <title>Cedarville Ii: Hidden Agenda - David Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost a year has passed since the Lakeside Murder case. Its said that Paul Vito had hidden a large amount of money somewhere near a graveyard before he had died. It was never proven to be true so people think that its just rumor.
	Out in Ash ridge, a few miles from Cedarville Lake construction had begun on a shopping center/hotel complex but had to be stopped when workers unearthed some American Indian artifacts. A state archeological team is surveying the area and recovering them so construction can resume.
	Right now the Cedarville Police Department is investigating a case involving the death of a college student caused by drugs that have recently resurfaced in the community.
	Even among law enforcement a conspiracy still looms. Has everyone connected with Paul Vito been caught? is on peoples minds.
	While the death of his former partner still haunts him, Inspector Dan Guthrie and his partner Detective John Taylor will soon discover that there is a hidden agenda in their community and will have to do whatever they can to bring the guilty to justice." />
