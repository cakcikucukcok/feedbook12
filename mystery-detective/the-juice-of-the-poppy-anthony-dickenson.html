  <title>The Juice of the Poppy - Anthony  Dickenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Electronics expert Steve Dalton owns a medical equipment agency in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. His business takes him all over the world. Last year, a chance alliance with Cecil Liu, a shrewd Chinese businessman, and Tim Foster, an ex-SAS officer, created a uniquely qualified trio who successfully took on Middle Eastern terrorists aiming to wreck the American economy. Steve, Cecil, and Tim, on their mission in the preceding novel, The Strangling of Satan, became known to Western Security Forces as &quot;The Unholy Trinity.&quot; Now, a year later, the West is calling on the group&#39;s skills yet again. The latest mission stems from the fear that the war against illicit drugs, heroin in particular, is being lost, costing society an astronomical amount. The trio&#39;s task is to discover the drug syndicates&#39; new distribution routes and the ethnic groups involved, and to develop a counter strategy. Each man in the Trinity faces life-and-death struggles while taking on this dangerous mission. Collaboration with Interpol and international drug agencies take them from Myanmar to Thailand, Singapore, Marseille, and the UK. Corruption is everywhere and no one can be trusted. However, even in the thick of things, love and romance still manage to flourish." />
