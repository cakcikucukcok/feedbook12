  <title>Tinfoil Butterfly - Rachel Eve Moulton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;A brutal, incredibly bizarre exploration of insanity, guilt, love, and the darkness inside all of us . . . This novel is a hybrid monster that&#39;s part Lovecraftian nightmare and part literary exploration of evil.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gabino Iglesias, NPR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Emma is hitchhiking across the United States, trying to outrun a violent, tragic past, when she meets Lowell, the hot-but-dumb driver she hopes will take her as far as the Badlands. But Lowell is not as harmless as he seems, and a vicious scuffle leaves Emma bloody and stranded in an abandoned town in the Black Hills with an out-of-gas van, a loaded gun, and a snowstorm on the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The town is eerily quiet and Emma takes shelter in a diner, where she stumbles across Earl, a strange little boy in a tinfoil mask who steals her gun before begging her to help him get rid of &quot;George.&quot; As she is pulled deeper into Earl&#39;s bizarre, menacing world, the horrors of Emma&#39;s past creep closer, and she realizes she can&#39;t run forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tinfoil Butterfly &lt;/i&gt;is a seductively scary, chilling exploration of evil--how it sneaks in under your skin, flaring up when you least expect it, how it throttles you and won&#39;t let go. The beauty of Rachel Eve Moulton&#39;s ferocious, harrowing, and surprisingly moving debut is that it teaches us that love can do that, too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
