  <title>Love &amp; Death in Burgundy - Susan C. Shea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From critically acclaimed author, Susan C. Shea, comes &lt;i&gt;Love &amp; Death in Burgundy&lt;/i&gt;, an atmospheric mystery novel filled with good Chablis, french cheese, and, of course, murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years of living in the small town of Reigny-sur-Canne, all Katherine Goff really wants is to be accepted by her neighbors into their little community. But as an American expat living in the proud region of Burgundy, that&#39;s no easy task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the elderly Frenchman who lives in the village chateau is found dead at the bottom of a staircase, the town is turned into a hot bed of gossip and suspicion, and Katherine suddenly finds herself drawn deeper and deeper into the small town&#39;s secrets. A motherless teenager, a malicious French widow, a brash music producer, and a would-be Agatha Christie are among those caught up in a storm that threatens to turn Katherine&#39;s quiet life upside down. As more and more of the villagers&#39; secrets are brought to light, Katherine must try to figure out who, if anyone, in the town she can trust, and which one of her neighbors just might be a killer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
