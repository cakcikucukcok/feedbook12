  <title>The Masque of a Murderer - Susanna Calkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Susanna Calkins&#39;s next richly drawn mystery set in 17th century England, Lucy Campion, formerly a ladies&#39; maid in the local magistrate&#39;s household, has now found gainful employment as a printer&#39;s apprentice. On a freezing winter afternoon in 1667, she accompanies the magistrate&#39;s daughter, Sarah, to the home of a severely injured Quaker man to record his dying words, a common practice of the time. The man, having been trampled by a horse and cart the night before, only has a few hours left to live. Lucy scribbles down the Quaker man&#39;s last utterances, but she&#39;s unprepared for what he reveals to her--that someone deliberately pushed him into the path of the horse, because of a secret he had recently uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fearful that Sarah might be traveling in the company of a murderer, Lucy feels compelled to seek the truth, with the help of the magistrate&#39;s son, Adam, and the local constable. But delving into the dead man&#39;s background might prove more dangerous than any of them had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Masque of a Murderer&lt;/i&gt;, Susanna Calkins has once again combined finely wrought characters, a richly detailed historical atmosphere, and a tightly-plotted mystery into a compelling read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
