  <title>Before and After - Rosellen Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written, compassionate and wise, Rosellen Brown&#39;s novel is the extraordinary story of a family&#39;s struggle to survive the throes of a tragedy. &lt;i&gt;Before and After &lt;/i&gt;centers on Carolyn and Ben Reiser and their two children, Judith and Jacob, who live comfortably in a small New England town. When the chief of police comes looking for seventeen-year-old Jacob to question him about the bludgeoning to death of his girlfriend, the Reisers&#39; lives are changed forever. Before and After is the compelling drama of the search for Jacob, his capture, and the chain of events set in motion by a brutal crime of passion. It is a story that pits parent against parent, brother against sister, family against community, blood loyalty against the law. With a flawless ear for dialogue and profound understanding of character and motive, Rosellen Brown has written a heart-wrenching novel that questions the very nature of violence in our society and our ability to ever really know our children.&lt;/p&gt;" />
