&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Napolean French is arrogant and difficult to deal with; he was also Sams competition for the promotion. He has long been at odds with his coworkers and has a thing for the chief of polices niece, even though she wants nothing to do with him. But Sams promotion sends Frenchy over the edge. Now, all he can think about is revenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After harassing the chiefs niecewho makes it clear that shes interested in Sam insteadFrenchy is placed on administrative leave, and Sam begins to hear rumors of his former colleagues shady past. It turns out Frenchy likes to sell drugs. When Sam starts to investigate, Frenchy takes things into his own hands. He frames Sam for murder, starting a chain reaction of tragedy that Sam is hard put to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Frenchy on the loose and Sam forced to prove his innocence, the chase is onbut bringing the former cop to justice might prove too tough for Sam to handle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
