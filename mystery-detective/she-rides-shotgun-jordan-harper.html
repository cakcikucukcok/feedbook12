He takes her from the front of her school into a world of robbery, violence, and the constant threat of death. And he does it to save her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nate made dangerous enemies in prison&amp;#8212;a gang called Aryan Steel has put out a bounty on his head, counting on its members on the outside to finish him off.

And Polly is their next target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nate and Polly&amp;#8217;s lives soon become a series of narrow misses, of evading the bad guys and the police, of sleepless nights in motels. Out on the lam, Polly is forced to grow up early: with barely any time to mourn her mother, she must learn how to take a punch and pull off a drug-house heist. She finds herself transforming from a shy little girl into a true fighter. Nate, in turn, learns what it&amp;#8217;s like to love fiercely and unconditionally&amp;#8212;a love he&amp;#8217;s never quite felt before. But can their powerful bond transcend the dangerous existence he&amp;#8217;s carved out for them? Will they ever be able to live an honest life, free of fear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She Rides Shotgun&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping and emotionally wrenching novel that upends even our most long-held expectations about heroes, villains, and victims. Nate takes Polly to save her life, but in the end it may very well be Polly who saves him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
