Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin--now the star of a hit show on Acorn TV and public television--is back on the case and poking around where she doesn&#39;t belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agatha Raisin, private detective, resident in the Cotswold village of Carsely, should have been a contented and happy woman...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in M.C. Beaton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Pushing Up Daisies&lt;/i&gt;, things are about to get a little less cozy. Lord Bellington, a wealthy land developer, wants to turn the community garden into a housing estate. And when Agatha and her friend Sir Charles Fraith attempt to convince Lord Bellington to abandon his plans, he scoffs, &quot;Do you think I give a damn about what a lot of pesky villagers want?&quot; So it&#39;s no surprise that some in the town are feeling celebratory when Agatha finds his obituary in the newspaper two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The villagers are relieved to learn that Bellington&#39;s son and heir, Damian, has no interest in continuing his father&#39;s development plans. Except the death was apparently murder, and the police see Damian as suspect number one--though Agatha finds plenty of others when he hires her to find the real killer. The good news is that a handsome retired detective named Gerald has recently moved to town. Too bad he was seen kissing another newcomer...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, another murder further entangles Gerald and Agatha in a growing web of intrigue as they work with her team of detectives work to uncover the killer&#39;s identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
