Bronwen and Jamila are becoming good friends when Jamila finds out from her parents that they have arranged a marriage for her back in Pakistan. Evans tries to convince her family not to enforce the custom, arguing that Jamila is a normal Welsh teenager, but just as the tensions increase, the girl suddenly vanishes. Bronwen is distraught, but there&#39;s no trace of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At work, Evans is investigating the murder of a man shot to death through the open window of his home while eating breakfast. After the man&#39;s wife is jailed as a suspect, a second man is killed---and then a third---and Evans and his team are on the hunt for a serial killer. But they can&#39;t seem to find any connections between the three men....&lt;/p&gt;" />
