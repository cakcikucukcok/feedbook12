  <title>Shadows in Jerome - Curtis D. Vick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Shadows in Jerome is a tale which introduces the reader to the old town of Jerome on Mingus Mountain in its heyday as the center of the world&#39;s copper mining industry, but it is also a story involving the town&#39;s &quot;afterlife&quot; as a tourist attraction and a historical site; a treasure to travelers from all over the world. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jerome is a real town, and the dynamics and vitality of the things which happened there in years long gone rival those of any old western town in the United States.  Today, it is a so-called ghost town.  Much of what it was has vanished.  Still, it&#39;s amazing that so much of it remains.  At less than two square miles in size, and with no more then fifteen thousand residents at any one time and far fewer than that for most of its life, it was a mighty midget of a town.  Some of its one-time residents are said to still be present in a few of its old buildings, albeit in different form. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In this story, a couple of young wayfarers encounter more adventure and mystery than they bargain for when they find the old town paradoxically in a state of death and decay as well as vibrant activity; its streets and shops filled by the bustle and gaity of tourists who come to walk its quaint up-and-down sidewalks and see the old buildings that once made up the city of Jerome, Arizona, the billion dollar copper town. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The old place was once the center of serious endeavor by men of means, men of ambition and authority, as well as men who felt nothing should be allowed to block their path toward wealth and power. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desire for these things was not the only kind of passion which existed in Jerome; love in all of its attendant forms was present as well, for beautiful women lived there. 
&lt;p&gt;But there is even more in Shadows in Jerome.  Mystery, and a touch of horror complete this story.  The wild and grand spectacle of the mountains and the nearby Verde Valley, as well as the picturesque charm of the old town in the clean air high on the side of Mingus Mountain not only help to hide evil, but they assist in posing philosophical questions as well; is it love, or through hate, that one finds forever? And by what means does one reach it?
&lt;p&gt;Enter the pages of this novel and you will be able to feel the forgotten years that pervade the old streets of Jerome as the very past seems to rear itself before you; here men and women lived and died.  Haroltry, gambling and heavy drinking were not any more unusual here than was the coming of the long shadows at the end of each day.  What is in store for those who lie for profit and love? What happens when young girls are taken too soon? How does one pay for transgressions against life and the living? Shadows in Jerome addresses these questions in a very unique way. 
&lt;p&gt;At less than two square miles in size, and with no more than fifteen thousand residents at any one time and far fewer than that for most of its life, it was one mightly midget of a town." />
