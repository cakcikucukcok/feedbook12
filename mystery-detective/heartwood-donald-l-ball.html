  <title>Heartwood - Donald L. Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jolted by a blow to his personal life, detective Jason Carmichael leaves California to recapture a time when, as a youth, life seemed much less sinister...or so he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day into his self-imposed R &#39;n R near a samll Ohio town, he notices a peculiar feature at a covered bridge which funnels him into the lives of the Muellers, an Amish family who had suffered the loss of their daughter twenty-five years earlier. At the time, rumor of an accident, a possible suicide, or murder abounded, but no one seemed to care, and it appears no one has expressed any interest ever since. Was it because Friedel Mueller&#39;s rebellious side caused friction within her community when she refused to be denied a high school education?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well outside his jurisdiction, Jason assumes the role of a private investigator and shares his finding with a skeptical county deputy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After confronting a frustrating array of suspects, Jason reunites with a trusted ally and learns the best way to lubricate an interrogation is with a bottle of tequila.&lt;/p&gt;" />
