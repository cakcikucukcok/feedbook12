  <title>Deal Master - Adam Gittlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Power Broker Jonah Gray is home. But does that mean Amsterdam, or New York City? Will he be &quot;Ivan Janse&quot; or &quot;Jonah Gray?&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing is certain-Jonah, as always, is steeled to get where he needs to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time around, the stakes couldn&#39;t be higher. Someone from Jonah&#39;s past is back in a big way. Jonah has been strong-armed into using his knowledge of the business of skyscrapers to assist in a nefarious, global scheme-and failure, as has been made clear, is simply not an option. There are monstrous deals and piles of cash to be made. There are reputations-even lives-to be lost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facing the horrors of the past, Jonah&#39;s own demons start to encroach as Perry, the woman he loves, seems to sink deeper and deeper into drugs-or insanity.  Jonah could be cracking under stress just as he needs maximum focus. He has always been able to call up his resolute strength of character and it&#39;s never been needed more than now.  Jonah is in for the fight of his life. Not just for himself-not just for Perry-for an entire industry. &lt;/p&gt;" />
