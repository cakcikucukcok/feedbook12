  <title>Breaking Point - Dana Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Haynes is a gifted writer who grabs you on page one and doesn&#39;t let you go until the final page.&quot; -- Nelson DeMille&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Three NTSB experts - people brought in to help investigate whenever a plane goes down - find themselves victims and witnesses rather than investigators when the plane they are on crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En route to a conference, three NTSB experts -- known to insiders as &quot;Crashers&quot; -- Tommy Tomzak, a pathologist from Texas; Kiki Duvall, a sound engineer and former naval officer; and Isaiah Grey, investigator and former FBI agent - are aboard a twin turbo prop plane when, just outside of Helena, Montana, the plane crashes into a thickly forested moutainside.  But the crash isn&#39;t an accident - it was brought down on purpose - and the &quot;Crashers&quot; weren&#39;t the target. The plane was brought down by mercenaries, led by an enigmatic, shadowy self-described patriot known only as Calendar, using weapons technology banned by international treaty.  The targets - three men who planned to blow the whistle on the weapons technology and the power brokers behind its development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a twisty, compelling thriller that goes from the streets of Spain, to the mountains of the western United States, to the heart of  the dark, hidden corridors of power where there are dangerous secrets that few suspect and fewer know, the &quot;Crashers&quot; are literally dropped in the middle of a case that neither starts, nor ends, with a plane crash with some of their own on-board.  A new team of Crashers fights time, as a fire rages ever closer to the wreckage, conflicting and confusing evidence, and unpredictable outside forces trying to prevent them from uncovering the truth. With alllies - unseen and even unknown - working behind the scenes to help them, the team is trapped in the midst of a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse with the deadliest of consquences, a game that not all of them will survive...&lt;/p&gt;" />
