  <title>Murder in an Irish Village - Carlene O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A little slice of Heaven on the Emerald Isle&amp;hellip;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the small village of Kilbane, County Cork, Ireland, Natalie&#39;s Bistro has always been a warm and welcoming spot to visit with neighbors, enjoy some brown bread and tea, and get the local gossip. Nowadays twenty-two-year-old Siobh&amp;aacute;n O&#39;Sullivan runs the family bistro named for her mother, along with her five siblings, after the death of their parents in a car crash almost a year ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s been a rough year for the O&#39;Sullivans, but it&#39;s about to get rougher. One morning, as they&#39;re opening the bistro, they discover a man seated at a table, dressed in a suit as if for his own funeral, a pair of hot pink barber scissors protruding from his chest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the local garda suspecting the O&#39;Sullivans, and their business in danger of being shunned--murder tends to spoil the appetite--it&#39;s up to feisty redheaded Siobh&amp;aacute;n to solve the crime and save her beloved brood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ADVANCE PRAISE FOR CARLENE O&amp;rsquo;CONNOR AND &lt;i&gt;MURDER IN AN IRISH VILLAGE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;ldquo;If Janet Evanovich and Maeve Binchy wrote a book together,&amp;#160;Murder in  an Irish Village would be the result. The Irish setting rings with  authenticity and Siobhan O&#39;Sullivan is a character to savor. She&#39;s  funny, feisty, and fearless. I want her to be my new best friend.&amp;#160;I  also&amp;#160;want another book by Carlene O&amp;rsquo;Connor to read. This one  is&amp;#160;delicious fun.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Laurien Berenson, author of &lt;i&gt;Live and Let Growl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;ldquo;A  smart whodunnit in an idyllic locale.
