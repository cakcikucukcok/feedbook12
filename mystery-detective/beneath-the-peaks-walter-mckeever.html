  <title>Beneath the Peaks - Walter McKeever</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Redmond and Jennifer McClain weren&#39;t sure how it had all come abouttheir involvement in helping solve crimes, that is. Redmond, a psychology professor at Ravenslake University in Pleasanton, Ohio, and Jennifer, an artist specializing in landscapes and portraiture, had plenty of safe and enjoyable interests and good friends. Yet, somehow they had come very close to being thrown to their deaths from the rim of the Grand Canyon in 2005,and had barely missed being fatally shot in their cozy college town in 2008all because they had found mysteries so seductive. Given their close encounters of the potentially deadliest kind they&#39;d sworn off further interest in mysterious crimes. An now, here they are in beautiful Flagstaff, Arizona, on a a pleasant three-week August vacation, enjoying coffee at Barnes and Noble, and reading old newspaper accounts about an unsolved mystery in Flagstaff. Jennifer commented to her Redmond, &quot;It&#39;s a really interesting case, Mac. Fortunately, there&#39;s no way for us to get involved with it.&quot; Which just goes to show that even the very bright Jennifer McClain could be wrong from time to time." />
