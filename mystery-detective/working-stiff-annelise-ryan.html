      <meta name="description" content="When Mattie Winston catches her husband Dr. David Winston receiving some very special loving care from R.N. Karen Owenby, she quits her job and moves out. Mattie&#39;s best friend Izzy offers her a place to stay and suggests she&#39;d be a natural as deputy coroner. Now, instead of taking patients&#39; pulses, Mattie&#39;s weighing their hearts and livers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Mattie&#39;s first homicide call turns out to be for none other than Nurse Karen, and even though she saw her ex in a heated argument with the newly deceased the night before, she refuses to believe David could be a killer. Keeping mum about what she saw, Mattie is also left speechless by the sight of hunky Detective Steve Hurley.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From learning the ropes on her new job to sorting out her feelings about her ex and dealing with her growing attraction to Detective Hurley, Mattie&#39;s in deep water and in danger of sinking quickly, especially when she places herself dead center in the path of a desperate--yet determined--killer.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Annelise Ryan and Working Stiff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sassy, sexy, and suspenseful, Annelise Ryan knocks &#39;em dead in her wry and original &lt;i&gt;Working Stiff.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; --Carolyn Hart, author of &lt;i&gt;Dare to Die&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Make way for Mattie Winston, the funniest deputy coroner to cut up a corpse since, well, ever.&quot; --Laura Levine, author of &lt;i&gt;Killer Cruise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Ryan brings her professional expertise to her crisp debut.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
