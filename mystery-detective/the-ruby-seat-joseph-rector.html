  <title>The Ruby Seat - Joseph Rector</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cyril Bankstrom lives alone on the shores of a sparkling Adirondack lake. He is a quiet, humble man who---after great suffering---acquires a rare and mystical gift of sensing God&amp;#39;s Oneness in all things. But for the past 40 years the same haunting nightmare has tortured him---his hands are covered with blood; a child is screaming; a white house is burning, and in a large pine tree, a noose hangs in the moonlight. In the eyes of his one true friend, Eva, Cyril is perfect, and she has grown to love and admire him. He is the opposite of the things she hates about her imprisoned, alcoholic father. Then a stranger appears in the dark woods with the truth of the old man&amp;#39;s past. Cyril and Eva must journey deep in the forest to find the peace or death that awaits them.&lt;/p&gt;" />

After starting the book, it was hard to put down and when finished, I was longing for more. The character of Cyril Banks is that of a pure, gentle and loving man that left me with a sense of calm and humility.<br /><b><i>The Ruby Seat by Joseph Rector - Goodreads</i></b> | I finished The Ruby Seat by Joseph Rector and gave it 5 stars! Absolutely phenomenal! I loved it from beginning to end. Flowed very smoothly and the story was breathtaking. Has made me take a whole new outlook on life!! Well done Mr. Rector!<br /><b><i>The Ruby Seat: Rector, Joseph: 9781938467684: Amazon.com ...</i></b> | Near the summit of Whiteface Mountain there is a tiny section where the Whiteface memorial highway meets the hikers trail. On a perfectly still October morning while I stumbled over rocks and roots making my way up the hikers trail, someone else, 5 miles down the highway was also making their way up the 5th highest peak in New York State.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Ruby Seat - Joseph Rector</a> </h3></p><hr/>
