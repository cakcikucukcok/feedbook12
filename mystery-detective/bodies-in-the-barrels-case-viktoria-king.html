  <title>Bodies in the Barrels Case - Viktoria King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lieb Canavan is a procurator fiscal (coroner) in Scotland. He is married to Rose, whose sister Heather has recently birthed her first child, and Rose has planned to visit her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst preparing for this first separation, Lieb gets a call to work. Another body has been found in a blue barrel with the distinctive WB insignia on the side. He meets up with Senior Inspector Marcus Campbell, and the case takes on a life of its own, filling in the empty time Rose is away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Marcus, the case takes another turn when he is partnered with Senior Inspector Grace Scott, and his many protestations of being a career bachelor crash in around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Marcus and Grace helping close the bodies in the barrels case, Lieb lands another case, one that is far too close to home and one that will earn him the nickname the Iceman.&lt;/p&gt;" />
