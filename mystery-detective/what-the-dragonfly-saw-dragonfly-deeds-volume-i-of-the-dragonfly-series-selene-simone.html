  <title>What the Dragonfly Saw: Dragonfly Deeds Volume I of the Dragonfly Series - Selene Simone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pearl Alexandrine Danetree has always heard stories about the house in which she lives as other generations of family before her. But every old house has stories, and every old family has secrets. Talk about curses just sounds like some bad horror movie or science fiction story.   When Pearl dies, her niece Juliette Danetree, the sole legal heiress of her family&#39;s history and assets in Petit Coeur, returns to settle the affairs and sell Greyfriairs. She faces lies, a curse, and deception that hang like Spanish moss from all branches of her ancestral tree-a story that begins in 1742 and flows with the Danetree family from France to Louisiana.   An old trunk holds more questions than answers, and mysterious strangers attach themselves to her home and heart. Their truths lie in each other&#39;s hearts and in the blood they share. Juliette finds escape is not an option and her law background doesn&#39;t include lifting curses. She&#39;ll need more than legal skills to maneuver through the misdeeds of the past" />
