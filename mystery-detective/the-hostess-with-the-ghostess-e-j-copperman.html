  <title>The Hostess with the Ghostess - E. J. Copperman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Things are never quiet for long at the Haunted Guesthouse. Right as Alison Kerby finally gets some peace, long-time deceased Paul Harrison’s recently murdered brother, Richard, shows up looking for the ghostly detective. But Paul has left for parts unknown months ago. The only thing is, she doesn’t know how to find him. And she’s going to need to because Richard’s isn’t the only murder still left unsolved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As she searches for Paul, Alison discovers that Richard, who was a lawyer, was working a case about a woman accused of murdering her stepfather. It quickly becomes clear that Richard was getting too close to the truth, and was forcibly kept quiet. Now as Alison continues her investigation, she gets a creeping sensation that the murderer doesn’t appreciate her snooping around. And if she doesn’t stop, she’ll be next in &lt;i&gt;The Hostess with the Ghostess&lt;/i&gt;, the witty and delightful follow-up to national bestselling author E. J. Copperman’s &lt;i&gt;Spouse on Haunted Hill&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;" />
