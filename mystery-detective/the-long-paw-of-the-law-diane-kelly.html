A DOG-EAT-DOG WORLD. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, while on duty with her four-legged crime-fighting companion, Meg gets an urgent call from her boyfriend Seth, who works for the Fort Worth fire department.

Its leader, Father Emmanuel, keeps his followers on a short leash--and his enemies even closer. Could this be the abandoned baby&#39;s original home? And if so, why was she cast out? Now that Megan and Brigit are on the case, the secrets of this reclusive cult are bound to be dug up. . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diane Kelly is back with &lt;i&gt;The Long Paw of the Law&lt;/i&gt;, the seventh installment in her drool-worthy Paw Enforcement series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Four Paws Up!
