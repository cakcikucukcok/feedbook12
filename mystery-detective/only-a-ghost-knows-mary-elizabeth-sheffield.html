  <title>Only a Ghost Knows - Mary Elizabeth Sheffield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Amy Fletcher is a skilled Psychic, but her profession hasnt been easy, since she was raised by strict, religious parents who disapproved of her talents. But troubled spirits do not stay silent, and Amys calling is one she follows with her whole heart.
Responding to a frantic call from her closest friend, Amy travels across country to help solve a haunting at the Dandelion Care Home. She unwittingly finds herself being the victim of intrigue, a romance cloaked in deception, and attempted murder. After meeting the homes owner, Mrs. Dorothy Cruella Green, whose nickname was well-earned, Amy realizes that she has a hidden agenda putting everyones lives at risk. Dorothys desperation to sell her haunted home is thwarted with objects moving, music coming through the walls, and lonesome cries wailing at night.
As Amy stubbornly pushes forward to put this ghost to rest, she gets unexpected help from the homes lone employee, the peculiar Jamaican caretaker, Tandi Davis. Only Tandi understands the houses past tragedies and is there to protect those who are dead and alive. Skillfully maneuvering through the spirit world, Amy slowly unravels a mystifying murder which helps her solve the mysteries surrounding the haunted home." />
