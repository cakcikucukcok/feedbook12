  <title>Death Was in the Picture - Linda L. Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1931, while most of Los Angeles is struggling to survive the Depression, the business of Hollywood is booming. And everyone wants a piece. The movies have always been cutthroat and, as girl Friday Kitty Pangborn is about to find out, that&#39;s more than a metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitty&#39;s boss, private detective Dexter Theroux, has been asked to help leading man Laird Wyndham prove his innocence. The actor was the last person to be seen with a young actress who died under very suspicious circumstances, and the star has fallen from the big screen to the big house. Wyndham&#39;s a dreamboat, but that isn&#39;t the only thing that has Kitty hot under the collar. Dex has already signed a client---one who&#39;s hired him to prove Wyndham&#39;s hands are not as clean as they look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing Hollywood glitz with hard-boiled grit, &lt;i&gt;Death Was in the Picture &lt;/i&gt;captures the essence of life in Depression-era Los Angeles: a world where times are tough, talk is cheap, and murder is often just one scene away.&lt;/p&gt;" />
