  <title>All That&#39;s Left to Tell - Daniel Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Like Tim O&#39;Brien&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Going After Cacciato&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;All That&#39;s Left to Tell&lt;/i&gt; celebrates not just the power of storytelling but the deeply human need for it in even the most dire situations. Alternately gripping and dreamy, Daniel Lowe&#39;s debut imagines what the stories we tell reveal about ourselves, and how they may save us.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Stewart O&#39;Nan, author of &lt;i&gt;West of Sunset&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every night, Marc Laurent, an American taken hostage in Pakistan, is bound and blindfolded. And every night, a woman he knows only as Josephine visits his cell. At first, her questions are mercenary: is there anyone back home who will pay the ransom? But when Marc can offer no name, she asks him a question about his daughter that is even more terrifying than his captivity. And so begins a strange yet increasingly comforting ritual, in which Josephine and Marc tell each other stories. As these stories build upon one another, a father and daughter start to find their way toward understanding each other again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
