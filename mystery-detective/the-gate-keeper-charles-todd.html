  <title>The Gate Keeper - Charles Todd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a deserted road, late at night, Scotland Yard&amp;#8217;s Ian Rutledge encounters a frightened woman standing over a body, launching an inquiry that leads him into the lair of a stealthy killer and the dangerous recesses of his own memories in this twentieth installment of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after his sister&amp;#8217;s wedding, a restless Ian Rutledge drives aimlessly, haunted by the past, and narrowly misses a motorcar stopped in the middle of a desolate road. Standing beside the vehicle is a woman with blood on her hands and a dead man at her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She swears she didn&amp;#8217;t kill Stephen Wentworth. A stranger stepped out in front of their motorcar, and without warning, fired a single shot before vanishing into the night. But there is no trace of him. And the shaken woman insists it all happened so quickly, she never saw the man&amp;#8217;s face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he is a witness after the fact, Rutledge persuades the Yard to give him the inquiry, since he&amp;#8217;s on the scene. But is he seeking justice&amp;#8212;or fleeing painful memories in London?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wentworth was well-liked, yet his bitter family paint a malevolent portrait, calling him a murderer. But who did Wentworth kill? Is his death retribution? Or has his companion lied? Wolf Pit, his village, has a notorious history: in Medieval times, the last wolf in England was killed there. When a second suspicious death occurs, the evidence suggests that a dangerous predator is on the loose, and that death is closer than Rutledge knows.&lt;/p&gt;" />
