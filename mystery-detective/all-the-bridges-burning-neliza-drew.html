  <title>All the Bridges Burning - Neliza Drew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sisters bound by tragedy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Davis Groves grew up in a&amp;nbsp;volatile&amp;nbsp;environment. With a dead father and an addict mother, Davis learned early to do whatever it took to survive: fight, lie, steal&amp;hellip;even sell her body for money to&amp;nbsp;get by. Above all, she knew it was her job to protect her sisters&amp;mdash;always.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, she&amp;rsquo;s settled into a somewhat normal life away from her family, complete with a respectable job, apartment and boyfriend. Her demons have been put to rest, mostly, her old obligations abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So when her mother calls for help, Davis is all too willing to ignore her&amp;hellip;until she says Davis&amp;rsquo;s little sister has been arrested for murder. There&amp;rsquo;s no question Davis will go back, that she&amp;rsquo;ll try to save her sister any way she can. It&amp;rsquo;s what she was trained to do.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As she investigates, the events surrounding her sister&amp;rsquo;s arrest begin to unravel, the past Davis thought she&amp;rsquo;d buried and her sister&amp;rsquo;s present collide, and Davis is forced to question if she can ever forgive herself for leaving her sister behind.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She may not live long enough to try.&lt;/p&gt;" />
