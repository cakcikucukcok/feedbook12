      <meta name="description" content="On a cold night in January, a newborn baby was abandoned in front of a convent of nuns. It immediately seemed strange and inexplicable that the baby was found completely naked in a basket, in danger of dying of exposure...
However, the child survived miraculously and was adopted a month later.
As the years passed, Salvo realized that he was different from his peers, but he did not know why. Meanwhile, many doubts and questions were coming to the surface, until he understood by chance that his father and mother were not his biological parents, and started looking for them and asking who they were, why they had abandoned him, and why he was so different...
But who were his true and mysterious parents...?
Once discovered, only they could give him the key to open the doors of this great mystery..." />
