  <title>A Forger&#39;s Tale - Michael Saint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Saint was convicted at an East London Court for printing the largest amount of foreign currency ever found in Britain.  The currency was Spanish pesetas and he was sentenced to six years imprisonment.  In the dock with him stood John Dean, Sylvia Smith and a Grass.  Born into a poor East London Family, Michael Saint became the most successful forger in British history.  Michael manages to laugh at himself and you will laugh along with him. Humour has replaced mindless violence and foul language usually to be found in True Crime books. This is the story of his early life, the events leading up to the printing of the money, his arrest and subsequent life in prison." />
