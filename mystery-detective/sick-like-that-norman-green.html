  <title>Sick Like That - Norman Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Last Gig&lt;/em&gt; features a tough and edgy, one-of-a-kind heroine&amp;#8212;an entirely fresh take on the hardboiled women private investigators who dominate so many crime fiction classics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PI Marty Stiles was shot and paralyzed and is now in rehab, trying to decide whether to fight to recover. Meanwhile, his agency is being run by two women: the street-smart and savvy Alessandra Martillo, who&amp;#8217;s the muscle, and Sarah Waters, a na&amp;#239;ve, single mom, new to the job but who quickly becomes the brains. Though the two women grew up only a few miles from each other in Brooklyn, it might as well have been worlds apart. Now they&amp;#8217;re partners, and for all their differences, are committed to their joint venture. When Sarah&amp;#8217;s deadbeat ex-husband gets into trouble, Al would rather let him suffer, but she agrees to help Sarah figure out where he is and why another man has ended up dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gritty and unputdownable, this is perfect for fans of James Lee Burke and Robert Crais.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
