  <title>False Impression - Jeffrey Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why was an elegant lady brutally murdered the night before 9/11? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was a successful New York banker not surprised to receive a woman&#39;s left ear in the morning mail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did a top Manhattan lawyer work only for one client, but never charge a fee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did a young woman with a bright career steal a priceless Van Gogh painting? &lt;br&gt;Why was an Olympic gymnast paid a million dollars an assignment when she didn&#39;t have a bank account? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was an honors graduate working as a temporary secretary after inheriting a fortune? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was an English Countess ready to kill the banker, the lawyer and the gymnast even if it meant spending the rest of her life in jail? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was a Japanese steel magnate happy to hand over $50,000,000 to a woman he had only met once?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was a senior FBI agent trying to work out the connection between these eight apparently innocent individuals? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these questions are answered in Jeffrey Archer&#39;s latest novel, &lt;i&gt;False Impression&lt;/i&gt;, but not before a breathtaking journey of twists and turns that will take readers from New York to London to Bucharest and on to Tokyo, and finally a sleepy English village, where the mystery of Van Gogh&#39;s last painting will finally be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And only then will readers discover that Van Gogh&#39;s &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Self-portrait with Bandaged Ear&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt; has a secret of its own that acts as the final twist in this unforgettable yarn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
