  <title>Black Hour - Lori Rader-Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Chicago sociology professor Amelia Emmet, violence was a research topic--until a student she&#39;d never met shot her. He also shot himself. Now he&#39;s dead and she&#39;s back on campus, trying to keep up with her class schedule, a growing problem with painkillers, and a question she can&#39;t let go: Why? All she wants is for life to get back to normal, but normal is looking hard to come by. She&#39;s thirty-eight and hobbles with a cane. Her first student interaction ends in tears (hers). Her fellow faculty members seem uncomfortable with her, and her ex--whom she may or may not still love--has moved on. Enter Nathaniel Barber, a graduate student obsessed with Chicago&#39;s violent history. Nath is a serious scholar, but also a serious mess about his first heartbreak, his mother&#39;s death, and his father&#39;s disapproval. Assigned as Amelia&#39;s teaching assistant, Nath also takes on the investigative legwork that Amelia can&#39;t do. And meanwhile, he&#39;s hoping she&#39;ll approve his dissertation topic, the reason he came to grad school in the first place: the student attack on Amelia Emmet. Together and at cross-purposes, Amelia and Nathaniel stumble toward a truth that will explain the attack and take them both through the darkest hours of their lives. From the Trade Paperback edition." />
