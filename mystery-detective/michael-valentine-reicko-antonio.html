  <title>Michael Valentine - Reicko Antonio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young Michael Valentine narrates a first-hand account of his journey with words expressed in a manner that enables the reader to see everything down to the last detail as if you were watching it on the big screen. Following the death of his father, hes forced to become the man of the house. His vivid description of his life story helps you visualize his transition from a young naive Christian boy to a youthful contract killer hired by two of the largest crime families in the Metropolitan area and on the East Coast. You will feel his pain from the loss of his father to the betrayal of close friends and confidants as well as his pleasure he receives through his accomplishments. He not only grows into a man through his sexual and physical changes, but he learns the definition of loyalty, family, and greed as well. Travel with Michael as he takes you for a night on the town all around DC, Maryland, and Virginia and to various cities, countries, and bedrooms. Some of his sexual encounters are casual, few are emotional, but the majority is a part of business. Ride with him in exotic cars and walk with him as he stalks his target and takes them out. Nothings sugar coated; its as real as it gets. He realizes that he becomes addicted to sex, murder and money. You wont just read the diary of a hit man; youll see it as he lives it." />
