  <title>My Snowy Evening of Hell... - David Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective David Daniels was in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound when his wife was kidnapped. 
The investigation started when he teamed up with
his old friend on the police squad. The prisoners involved were very devious on how they escaped the jail and must have had everything planned for a long time. 
These convicts were ones that David had testified against at trial. They had received some information from someone that has always been hostile towards the detective. 
The Boss has lost a lot of money in the past because of all of the digging that David had been doing. He wanted to get his revenge and this was a good place for him to start. 
This was the first step of many that the Boss had and he hoped that it would be putting the detective in jail. All things went right for a while for the Boss until David turned things around and went after the people that took his wife. 
He had new information for the three inmates and used it the way he was trained to do." />
