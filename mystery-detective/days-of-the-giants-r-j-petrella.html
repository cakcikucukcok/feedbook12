  <title>Days of the Giants - R.  J. Petrella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in the politically tumultuous Boston medical world of the early 1990s, Days of the Giants follows intern Slater Barnes through a conflict between Boston City Hospital staff and corrupt municipal officials.    Despite facing a life-threatening medical diagnosis of his own, Barnes chooses to train in one of the country&#39;s most demanding teaching institutions, Boston City Hospital. Inspired by the public hospital&#39;s mission to treat patients regardless of personal resources, and undaunted by its deteriorating physical condition, Barnes finds meaning in his work and falls in love with the institution.    But when Boston mayor Peter Doyle pushes a vast rebuilding plan for the hospital through Boston City Council, corrupt city officials mastermind a scheme to turn the plan into a profit.  In so doing, they threaten the hospital&#39;s very existence and force Barnes and the rest of the BCH staff to defend it.  Then, a resident is murdered...  A portion of the proceeds from sales of this book will be donated to Boston-area hospitals and health-related charities." />
