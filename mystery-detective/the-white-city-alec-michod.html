  <title>The White City - Alec Michod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the year of our lord, 1893. The crackle of electricity&#39;s first sparks, the mechanical whine of Ferris&#39;s wheel, the tinkling of crystal from the majestic city atop the hill--the sounds of a new era pervade the air as the century&#39;s last World&#39;s Fair commences in Chicago.&lt;br&gt;But darkness lurks beneath the metropolis so austere it has been dubbed the White City. Strikes loom on the horizon, racism runs rampant, and a murderer unlike any America has ever seen before is on the loose, terrorizing the city. His crimes are so brutal, newspapers have christened him the Husker. Hiding behind the cloak of a city in chaos, he taunts his pursuers, littering the grounds of the fair with the corpses of children as he slips through the shadows.&lt;br&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Handley, the first forensic psychologist of her kind, has been called in to capture the killer, but when the son of prominent architect William Rockland goes missing, the case takes on an entirely new urgency. In this city of bombastic politics and cutthroat egos, everyone has his own agenda, but time is running out. As she races to save the boy, Dr. Handley fights to maintain her sanity as the line between captor and quarry blurs, and violence casts its spell.&lt;br&gt;From the depths of the seediest brothels to the pristine enclaves of the elite, &lt;i&gt;The White City&lt;/i&gt; is a strange, beguiling first novel by Alec Michod, a thriller that masterfully blends fact and fiction. An exhilarating voyeur&#39;s glimpse at Chicago in all its glory, it also probes the dark side that was never far from its core.&lt;/p&gt;" />
