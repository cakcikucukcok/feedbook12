  <title>Edge Of Madness - Keith A Hoar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &amp;lsquo;supposed&amp;rsquo; terrorist bombing rips through downtown Baltimore. A DOD communications system is plagued by interference. A U.S. Navy nuclear submarine is attacked for no apparent reason. Seemingly unconnected events plunge highly decorated, former U.S. Navy Seal, Zach Templeton into a nightmarish terror. Zach&amp;#39;s marriage is in shambles. His company, a lifelong dream, is on the verge of failing. His best friend makes a shocking discovery, putting himself in great peril. Zach is forced to confront the most ominous threat he has ever faced. Will he be able to stop the madness before it destroys him and everyone he loves?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A flag-rank officer, driven by rage and hatred over the death of his wife and daughters by a terrorist&amp;rsquo;s bomb, is determined to mete out revenge. The dream of long-awaited vengeance is all he lives for. His carefully crafted plan for revenge pushes the United States to the brink of World War III. Only days remain before it will be too late. Can anyone stop it? Tick, tick, tick. The clock is running.&lt;br /&gt;
