  <title>The Twelfth Department - William Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Captain Alexei Korolev has nothing to complain about. He has his own room in an apartment, a job in the police force that puts food on the table, and his good health. In Moscow in 1937, that&#39;s a lot more than most people have to be grateful for. But for the first time in a long time, Korolev is about to be truly happy: his son Yuri is coming to visit for an entire week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Yuri&#39;s arrival, however, Korolev receives an urgent call from his boss--it seems an important man has been murdered, and Korolev is the only detective they&#39;re willing to assign to this sensitive case. In fact, Korolev realizes almost immediately that the layers of sensitivity and secrecy surrounding this case far exceed his paygrade. And the consequences of interfering with a case tied to State Security or the NKVD can be severe--you might lose your job, if you&#39;re lucky. Your whole family might die if you&#39;re not. Korolev is suddenly faced with much more than just discovering a murderer&#39;s identity; he must decide how far he&#39;ll go to see justice served . . . and what he&#39;s willing to do to protect his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Twelfth Department&lt;/i&gt;, William Ryan&#39;s portrait of a Russian policeman struggling to survive in one of the most volatile and dangerous eras of modern history is mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
