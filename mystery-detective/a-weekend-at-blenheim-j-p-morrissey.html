  <title>A Weekend at Blenheim - J. P. Morrissey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this enthralling and atmospheric tale of murder, revenge and redemption, a young American struggles to make sense of a world he does not understand, where the price of acceptance may be murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Vanbrugh is an outsider in the England of 1905: A determined but unsuccessful American architect, he has moved to London to make a new life for himself and his wife, Margaret. When he receives an unexpected summons to meet the dazzling Duchess of Marlborough at Blenheim Palace, he is skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The young duchess, Vanbrugh comes to understand, has her reasons. Like him, she is American-born: Consuelo Vanderbilt, one of the richest debutantes in America. Seemingly on impulse, the duchess hires Vanbrugh to renovate her rooms at Blenheim - a plum job Vanbrugh accepts. He and his wife join the weekend party at Blenheim, a group that includes the foul-tempered duke; his young cousin Winston Churchill; the society painter John Singer Sargent; the duchess&#39; mother and American suffragette Mrs. O.H.P.Belmont; Gladys Deacon, an American friend of the duchess&#39;; and the enigmatic Catholic Monsignor Vay de Vaya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost as soon as he begins work at Blenheim, Vanbrugh uncovers a series of unsettling letters that hint at a long-concealed deceit. As he tries to grasp the meaning of this discovery, a sketchbook owned by Sargent is stolen and a young housemaid is found in the courtyard, strangled. It is then that Vanbrugh realizes he is caught in a maze of duplicity and manipulation with no way out. Struggling to uncover the treachery he sees around him, Vanbrugh is forced to re-evaluate everything he thought about Blenheim, himself, even the very nature of truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part mystery, part gothic morality tale, &lt;i&gt;A Weekend at Blenheim&lt;/i&gt; is a compelling, mesmerizing, deeply satisfying novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
