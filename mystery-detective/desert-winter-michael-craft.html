  <title>Desert Winter - Michael Craft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After 30 some odd years of success as a director on Broadway, Claire Gray has accepted her first academic position - that of a theatrical director at the richly funded Desert Arts College in Palm Springs.  Having lived a largely peaceful life in Manhattan, she is stunned to find herself in the midst of the second murder - and murder investigation - in a matter of months in Palm Springs.  This time it&#39;s a local aged and ailing collector - who frequently lends pieces to local charity events or dramatic productions -  found dead shortly after Claire&#39;s friend and neighbor Grant Knoll was there.  With Grant a suspect in his murder, along with several others with equally good motives for wanting him dead, Claire decides to look into the circumstances of his unfortunate death.&lt;/p&gt;" />
