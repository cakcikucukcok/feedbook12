  <title>Celestial Pieces - Delmi Anyó</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For lovers of novels such as The Da Vinci Code, The Eight, or The Last Cato&lt;br/&gt;
What is the truth behind the death of someone you thought you knew? An unsettling message turns young New York professor Julia&#39;s world upside down and leads her to embark in a hasty journey to Europe.&lt;br/&gt;
Ancient mysteries and a dangerous secret that has been kept for centuries, and that somebody will go to any lengths for it to remain that way, will lead Julia into a thrilling adventure through the most fascinating European cities.&lt;br/&gt;
Madrid in the period of Charles V, alchemic Prague, London when the Royal Society was founded and Medici Paris, combined with the hermeticism of the Vatican Archives and arcane Rome are the settings for a dangerous race around the clock that could make heaven seem closer than it is... unless she wins the game. 
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA, BLOGS AND READERS GIVE THEIR OPINION:&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;CELESTIAL PIECES has a highly attractive plot.&quot;  &lt;b&gt;El Nuevo Herald, Miami&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Is there an Indiana Jones hiding deep inside your soul? Are history, art and mystery your passion? This novel is for you!&quot;  &lt;b&gt;El buscalibros&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;If what you need is a plot with suspense, twists, surprises, mysteries and loads of action, CELESTIAL PIECES is a must.&quot;  &lt;b&gt;Bookceando entre letras&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Plenty of adventure and hazards to remind us that a girl can live without a wardrobe, but never without her stilettos and a good-sized purse, because one day they could become her favorite weapons.&quot;  &lt;b&gt;El escritorio del Búho&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Watch out, Dan Brown! Totally recommend it!&quot;  &lt;b&gt;Amor y palabras&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Fast action, intrigue, sex and mystery all the way through. Full of references to humanity&#39;s greatest minds, sharing with us knowledge of the occult world that surrounds us.&quot;  &lt;b&gt;Marc-Amazon Spain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
