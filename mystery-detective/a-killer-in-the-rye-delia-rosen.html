  <title>A Killer in the Rye - Delia Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nashville Katz is about to be the main course of her own Early Bird Special! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has deli owner and former New Yorker Gwen &quot;Nashville&quot; Katz bitten off more than she can chew? The spunky owner of Murray&#39;s Pastrami Swami finds the McCoy&#39;s Bakery delivery guy dead right in front of her deli, and his employers want to settle someone&#39;s corned beef hash. With the pregnant wife of the expired driver due any minute and her policeman brother turning up the heat, Gwen&#39;s in quite a pickle--she&#39;s a prime suspect and is about to face a griddling hot enough to sizzle a Hebrew National Frankfurter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clearing her name and finding the killer won&#39;t be easy. Is it a newspaper editor with an off-the-record grudge? A dirty cop? Maybe a vegan with a serious beef? Between juggling two romances and making salami sandwiches, Gwen barely has time to dig for clues. But when she uncovers an un-kosher Katz family secret, she knows it&#39;s now.  .  .or never! Because the ties that bind.  .  .can also strangle! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Deadly Deli Mystery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A native of Brooklyn, New York, &lt;b&gt;Delia Rosen&lt;/b&gt; is the author of &lt;i&gt;A Brisket, A Casket&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;One Foot in the Gravy.&lt;/i&gt; She now lives in Maine. She spends her time between writing and searching for good bagels." />
