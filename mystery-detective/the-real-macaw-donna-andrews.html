  <title>The Real Macaw - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meg juggles twins, murder, and a back-talking bird in the next side-splittingly funny installment in the award-winning, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling series&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a 2am feeding for her four-month-old twins, Meg Langslow hears an odd noise and goes downstairs to find her living room filled with dozens of animals--cats, dogs, hamsters, gerbils, rabbits, guinea pigs, and a stunningly foul-mouthed macaw. She soon learns that financial woes have caused the local animal shelter to repeal its no-kill policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her kindhearted father, her zoologist grandfather, and other like-minded citizens have stolen all the shelter&#39;s animals, both as a gesture of protest and to protect them until the hated policy can be repealed. But the volunteer who was to transport the animals to new homes has been murdered. Was it the victim&#39;s tangled love life that drove someone to murder? Or the dark secrets behind local politics? And will Meg ever succeed in finding homes for all the animals that have landed in her life? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            Full of the hilarious shenanigans - avian as well as human - that have come to surround Meg and her eccentric band of friends and family, the latest from the one and only Donna Andrews will have you laughing until the very last page: it&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Real Macaw&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
