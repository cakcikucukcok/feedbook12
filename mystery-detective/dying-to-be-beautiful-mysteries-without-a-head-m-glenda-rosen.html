  <title>&quot;Dying to Be Beautiful&quot; Mysteries: Without a Head - M. Glenda Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Dying To Be Beautiful,&quot; is about the billion-dollar world of beauty. The mystery series takes place in The Hamptons, where the murdered and suspected murderers are often arrogant and obnoxious with a sense of entitlement. Private Investigator Jenna Preston and her long-time friend, Detective Troy Johnson, work together to solve these murders and other crimes.   However, the intriguing series is about much more than murders and mysteries. &quot;Dying To Be Beautiful&quot; explores the beauty-or lack of it-in humanity. It&#39;s about insights into human behavior, people&#39;s life choices and the impact of their choices on themselves and others.   The first book in the series, &quot;Dying to be Beautiful: Without a Head,&quot; begins with an ordinary occurrence transformed into a gruesome scene. &quot;The head in the sink stared up at her. Darcy Monroe, the owner of a popular, chic hair salon was used to this. Only this time, the head was there without a body.&quot;" />
