  <title>Nowhere Nice - Rick Gavin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The nastiest meth lord in three states is out for revenge on Southern repo-man Nick Reid in the next riotously funny Delta noir novel from Rick Gavin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time Nick Reid and his pal Desmond tangled with that crazy meth-dealer Boudrot, Boudrot landed in jail and Nick and Desmond helped themselves to the several hundred grand in cash hidden in his trailer. Now Boudrot&#39;s made a jailbreak and escaped into the bayou. In pure spiteful nastiness, Boudrot is three cuts above your regular dime-a-dozen lowlife, and it&#39;s a sure bet he&#39;s out for revenge on everyone involved in last year&#39;s incident. Nick and Desmond immediately set out to warn the innocent--relatively speaking, anyway--of trouble to come, and proceed to round up the troops for a showdown. But that Boudrot is even meaner and crazier than they&#39;ve bargained for, and Nick and Desmond will be lucky to make it through alive on this wild, wacky chase through the Mississippi Delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Nowhere Nice&lt;/i&gt;, Rick Gavin has done it again--readers will laugh aloud and feel like they&#39;ve been to Mississippi themselves as they cheer right alongside Nick and Desmond on their latest raucous adventure in the South.&lt;/p&gt;" />
