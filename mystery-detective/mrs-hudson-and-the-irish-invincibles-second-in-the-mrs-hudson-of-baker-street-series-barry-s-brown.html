  <title>Mrs. Hudson and the Irish Invincibles: Second in the Mrs. Hudson of Baker Street Series - Barry S. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Moira Keegan tries to recruit Sherlock Holmes to save her father&#39;s life, Holmes, Watson and Mrs. Hudson do their best to convince the 12-year old that she has misunderstood her father&#39;s situation. When, a short time later, they read that Moira&#39;s father was found dead in a sleazy waterfront inn, the members of London&#39;s premier consulting detective agency have a new client and a singular purpose. In this, the second in the Mrs. Hudson of Baker Street series, the part-time housekeeper and full-time sage of 221B will lead her colleagues in a quest for justice that will put them at odds with Scotland Yard, Irish revolutionaries, religious zealots, and even the &quot;London Times.&quot; Before Mrs. Hudson can bring everything to right she will need to enlist the assistance of Charles Stewart Parnell, the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and his mistress Katharine O&#39;Shea. BARRY S. BROWN has spent most of his professional life conducting research in the areas of mental health, criminology and drug abuse. He has published two books and more than a hundred journal articles and chapters examining those issues. He now lives with his wife, Ann, in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, an ocean and a century removed from the London of Sherlock Holmes." />
