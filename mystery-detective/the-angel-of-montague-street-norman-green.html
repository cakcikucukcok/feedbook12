  <title>The Angel of Montague Street - Norman Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the fall of &#39;73, Brooklyn, New York, is home to worn-down hotels, wiseguys, immigrants, the disturbed, the disenfranchised, and a few people just trying to make an honest buck. When Silvano Iurata&#39;s troubled brother, Noonie, rumored to be living in Brooklyn Heights, goes missing, Silvano returns to a place he swore he&#39;d never set foot in again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvano left Brooklyn a long time ago -- wanting to leave behind his family and their seedy mob connections, and a past that just won&#39;t stay buried. The jungles of Viet Nam felt more hospitable to him than his own hometown; now that he&#39;s back, he doesn&#39;t intend to stay for long. His cousin Domenic has harbored a deadly grudge against him for something that happened when they were teenagers, but they aren&#39;t kids anymore, and his cousin has some dangerous friends. Silvano needs to find out what happened to his brother and get out -- fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tale of revenge and redemption, &lt;em&gt;The Angel of Montague Street&lt;/em&gt; has the same vivid characters, razor-sharp detail, and dead-on dialogue that made Norman Green&#39;s debut novel, &lt;em&gt;Shooting Dr. Jack&lt;/em&gt;, an unforgettable snapshot of life on the streets of Brooklyn. With its perceptive, poignant heart and gripping plot, this is literary suspense at its best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
