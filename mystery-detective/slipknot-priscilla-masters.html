But things are rarely so black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Callum is found dead in his cell just two days after his arrest, it is accepted that he killed himself. But the coroner, Martha Gunn, dares to dig a little deeper, unravelling a truth that is far more disturbing and distressing than anything the papers could have made up. She is determined to solve the mysetery and reveal the truth behind the destroyed lives of two very different boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
