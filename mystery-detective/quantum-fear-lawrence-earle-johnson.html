  <title>Quantum Fear - Lawrence Earle Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this thriller, former clandestine agent Clayton Wolfe leads an unconventional team to find and secure a free-energy device that could revolutionize or destroy the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 1982 when Clayton Wolfes nemesis, Devon Barnes, appears uninvited on Wolfes doorstep at his remote cabin in the deep woods of Michigans Upper Peninsula. Barnes threatens to kill Terri Sommers if Wolfe doesnt find a local professor who has disappeared along with his world-destabilizing inventions in dark energy. Sommers, who enlisted Wolfes help to solve a previous mystery, is an AP investigative reporter with whom Wolfe developed a romantic relationship. &lt;br /&gt;
Wolfe recruits several former clandestine associates, as well as the local sheriff and coroner. He also persuades Terri to join the investigation to keep her safe and to bring her back into his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayhem ensues as a KGB assassin appears on the scene, and deadly incidents befall several of Wolfes former associates. As Wolfe, Terri, and crew battle these forces, they race to locate the professor and safeguard his invention. Covert plots swirl as mysterious agents arrive to counter their every move. The action culminates in a fast-paced battle to save themselves and the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
