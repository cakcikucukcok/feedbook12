  <title>The Pursuit of the House-Boat - John Kendrick Bangs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Giallo&lt;/b&gt; - novella (102 pagine) - Being Some Further Account of the Divers Doings of the Associated Shades, Under the Leadership of Sherlock Holmes, Esq.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For all Sherlock Holmes lovers, we decided to publish this time a novel with Sherlock Holmes written by John Kendrick Bangs, first issued in 1897 by Harper &amp;amp; Brothers. It was also serialised in the famous Harper&amp;#39;s Weekly during the same year, between February 6th and April 24th, 1897.&lt;br /&gt;
As reported on The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia online, &lt;i&gt;The Pursuit of the House-Boat&lt;/i&gt; is a novel dedicated to &amp;ldquo;A. Conan Doyle, Esq., with the author&amp;#39;s sincerest regards and thanks for the untimely demise of his great detective which made these things possible&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
After the &lt;i&gt;House-Boat&lt;/i&gt; had been hijacked by Captain Kidd at the end of A House-Boat on the Styx, the various members of its club decided that to track it down, a detective would have to be called in. So they hired Sherlock Holmes, who, at the time of the book&amp;#39;s publication, had indeed been declared dead by his creator.&lt;br /&gt;
This story is part of the so known &lt;i&gt;Associated Shades&lt;/i&gt; series, an exclusive men&amp;#39;s club in Hades, whose members are the shades of famous people, including Adam and Baron Munchausen but primarily classical writers: Homer, Confucius, Shakespeare, president Walter Raleigh, Johnson and Boswell, and many others. The series includes four books (&lt;i&gt;A House-Boat on the Styx&lt;/i&gt;, 1895, &lt;i&gt;The Pursuit of the House-Boat&lt;/i&gt;, 1897, &lt;i&gt;The Enchanted Type-Writer&lt;/i&gt;, 1899 and &lt;i&gt;Mr Munchausen&lt;/i&gt;,1901. All four books were illustrated by Peter Newell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
