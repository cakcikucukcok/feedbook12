      <meta name="description" content="Mexia is a novel that has been written in the form of the memoirs of J. C. Mulkey. J.C., at a very early age, discovers a murder.  As he grows up, he discovers more murders and vows to protect, defend, and bring the perpetrators to justice. Along the way, he faces the challenges of growing up, getting educated, and tackling the trials and errors of justice, but through it all he maintains his optimistic nature, his problem solving, and focuses on what he thinks is most important in life.&lt;p&gt;
J.C. loves his dogs and his mother. He is a loyal brother and son. He tries to do good things, but, sometimes he ends up putting himself in a frustrating position. Still, he triumphs because of the courage of his convictions that he will identify the murderer. He does his best to protect the community that he loves.&lt;p&gt;
Just how this murder mystery happened in Mexia is part of the historical journey that J.C. must learn before he really builds the case. At risk of life and limb, J.C. successfully negotiates the perils that make his life so difficult." />
