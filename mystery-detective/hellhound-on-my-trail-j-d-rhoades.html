  <title>Hellhound On My Trail - J.D. Rhoades</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Jack Keller is back in the desert, trying to make a new life for himself and trying to heal from the wounds, both physical and emotional, he suffered from the events of &lt;I&gt;Devils and Dust&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But trouble has a way of finding Jack. When he rescues a stranger from being beaten and robbed in a parking lot, the man claims to be carrying a message from the father who abandoned him years ago &amp;#151; a man who claims to have the secret behind the trauma Keller suffered in the first Gulf War.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jack&amp;#8217;s dying father, however, has his own secret agenda, and the beautiful and ruthless heiress to a powerful political dynasty is willing to go to bloody extremes to keep the past buried. When she turns to an amoral ex-government agent to silence him &amp;#147;by any means necessary&amp;#8221;, Jack Keller, former hunter of men, finds himself being hunted once again. But this time, he&amp;#8217;s all alone, with nothing and no one to hold back the dark tide of rage he&amp;#8217;s been fighting for years.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Jack Keller&amp;#8217;s demons are finally unleashed, there&amp;#8217;s going to be Hell to pay &amp;#151; and no one will be safe.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
