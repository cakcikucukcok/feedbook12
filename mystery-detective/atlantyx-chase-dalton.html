  <title>Atlantyx - Chase Dalton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Graduate student Valerie Russell investigates the possible psychological addiction to &lt;em&gt;Atlantyx&lt;/em&gt;, a popular new computer game. She finds much more than entertainment and it becomes a race against time to save the lives and souls of innocent young people--and herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garland King, vice-director of the School of Psychology, and Drake Benson, a leader in a national campus ministry, urge Valerie to closely examine one game, &lt;em&gt;Atlantyx.&lt;/em&gt; And she soon learns why. The ministry has tracked seventy-one students, all avid gamers, who have mysteriously disappeared. Coincidentally, the producer of the game has garnered sales in excess of one and a half billion dollars over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie&#39;s graduate work explodes into the challenge of a lifetime. She will investigate this threat that blurs the boundary between reality and fantasy, harming innocent people in its path. Her quest brings with it self-discovery, romance, and more than a hint of danger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
