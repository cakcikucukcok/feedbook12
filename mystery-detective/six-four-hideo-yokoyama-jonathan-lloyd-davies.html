  <title>Six Four - Hideo Yokoyama, Jonathan Lloyd-Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Named one of the best books of 2017 by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Literary Hub. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Best Japanese Crime Fiction of the Year Award. O&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ne of Vulture&#39;s 10 Best Thriller Books of 2017.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Already a bestseller in Japan and the U.K., this cinematic crime novel suffused with fascinating cultural details follows a police department reinvestigating a chilling kidnapping that stumped them 14 years earlier.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, The Must List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE NIGHTMARE NO PARENT COULD ENDURE. THE CASE NO DETECTIVE COULD SOLVE. THE TWIST NO READER COULD PREDICT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five days, the parents of a seven-year-old Japanese schoolgirl sat and listened to the demands of their daughter&#39;s kidnapper. They would never learn his identity. And they would never see their daughter alive again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourteen years later, the mystery remains unsolved. The police department&#39;s press officer--Yoshinobu Mikami, a former detective who was involved in the original case and who is now himself the father of a missing daughter--is forced to revisit the botched investigation. The stigma of the case known as &quot;Six Four&quot; has never faded; the police&#39;s failure remains a profound source of shame and an unending collective responsibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mikami does not aspire to solve the crime. He has worked in the department for his entire career, and while he has his own ambitions and loyalties, he is hoping simply to reach out to the victim&#39;s family and to help finally put the notorious case to rest. But when he spots an anomaly in the files, he uncovers secrets he never could have imagined. He would never have even looked if he&#39;d known what he would find. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An award-winning phenomenon in its native Japan--more than a million copies sold, and the winner of the Best Japanese Crime Fiction of the Year award--and already a critically celebrated top-ten bestseller in the U.K., Hideo Yokoyama&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Six Four &lt;/i&gt;is an unforgettable novel by a literary master at the top of his form. It is a dark and riveting plunge into a crime, an investigation, and a culture like no other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
