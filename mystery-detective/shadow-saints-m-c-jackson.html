  <title>Shadow Saints - M. C. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a fast-paced, suspense thriller about a religious cult, the Covenant of Saints, which has embraced terrorism to take back America to the shining nation they believe God originally intended it to be. It interweaves the story with that of the family who found itself entangled in their tentacles and their attempts to stop them from implementing their new order for America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his headquarters in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area of Idaho and over the course of fifteen years, Calvin Rood, self-declared Christ of the Second Coming, used conservative media and the web to gather followers. He sent tendrils of hope to the discouraged, privilege to the disenfranchised, validity and purpose to the wealthy, power to the politicians, and exclusivity to the devout. He amassed hundreds of thousands of followers, some of whom infiltrated vital components of the nation&amp;rsquo;s massive military-industrial complex to acquire the highly enriched uranium necessary to bring America to its knees. They are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Rood&amp;rsquo;s headquarters in the Bitterroot Mountains, his 300 soldier-followers have completed the bombs that will stun the America government into immobility. They only have to retrieve the bombs and deliver them to the targets. They are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nine years ago they made three mistakes. They abducted Laura Watkins, shot Senator Watkins, and made a powerful enemy of her brother, Sam Watkins. It was the worst day for the Watkins family, but it was the best day for freedom in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine years after the kidnapping of Laura Watkins, the Covenant of Saints is under surveillance by the Department of Justice. A raid is planned by the FBI and ATF on their headquarters in the Bitterroot Mountains. Sam, now an FBI agent, just discovered that his sister is still alive and probably with the Covenant of Saints. He is refused permission to get his sister out before the raid. Fearing another Branch Davidian fiasco, Sam goes in unsanctioned. There he reluctantly relies on a local woman, Mickey Sheean, to get to the cult&amp;rsquo;s compound unseen. Together they discover that the Covenant of Saints has the means to bring the American government to a full stop, and that they plan to implement their plans in a matter of hours. Now Sam must race against time to stop America&amp;#39;s Armageddon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the scary thing is, all of this can really happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
