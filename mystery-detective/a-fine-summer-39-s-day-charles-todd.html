An Inspector at Scotland Yard, he is planning to propose to the woman whom he deeply loves, despite intimations from friends and family that she may not be the wisest choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the north on this warm and gentle day, another man in love&amp;#8212;a Scottish Highlander&amp;#8212;shows his own dear girl the house he will build for her in September.

This death will set off a series of murders across England, seemingly unconnected, that Rutledge will race to solve in the weeks before the fateful declaration in August that will forever transform his world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the clouds of war gather on the horizon, all of Britain wonders and waits. With every moment at stake, Rutledge sets out to right a wrong&amp;#8212;an odyssey that will eventually force him to choose between the Yard and his country, between love and duty, and between honor and truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
