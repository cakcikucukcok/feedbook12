  <title>Lucky Stuff - Sharon Fiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Officially divorced, antiques picker and private investigator Jane Wheel finally faces the reality that she needs to sell her house, which means clearing out her extensive--and beloved--antique collection. While it&#39;s a daunting task, the preemptive move proves worthwhile when her house sells in one day. Finding herself suddenly homeless, Jane heads to her hometown, Kankakee, Illinois, to find that it, too, has been turned upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky Miller, a little-known comedian, is staging what he calls a comeback. It&#39;s all part of his plan to break into showbiz by making it seem like he&#39;s always been a big name. Suspicious of what Lucky&#39;s trying to prove and why he&#39;s chosen to prove it in Kankakee, Jane&#39;s mother, Nellie, hires Jane to investigate. But why does Nellie care? Lucky would sure like to know, so he, too, calls on Jane to find out. Still, Nellie may be the least of his problems when a driver on his crew turns up dead hours after claiming that Lucky tried to kill him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the charming and dogged Jane Wheel at the center of another clever puzzle, &lt;i&gt;Lucky Stuff&lt;/i&gt; is an outstanding addition to Sharon Fiffer&#39;s popular series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
