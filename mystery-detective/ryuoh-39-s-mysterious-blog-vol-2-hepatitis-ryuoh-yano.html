  <title>Ryuoh&#39;s Mysterious Blog Vol.2 - Hepatitis - Ryuoh Yano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ryuoh Yano is a Japanese mystery writer and a system engineer for a company. One day he began suffering from an inexplicable headache and fever. He first thought he might have caught his son&#39;s cold, but his condition was deteriorating. Forced to be absent from work, he was diagnosed in a hospital as hepatitis.  There are several reasons for hepatitis, any of which didn&#39;t seem to be applicable to Yano&#39;s case. However, behind his hepatitis hid the truth that he couldn&#39;t guess even though he was a mystery writer. Yano&#39;s final confession is so naked and forbidden that you (readers) would definitely be speechless.  This work was exclusively written for The BBB: Breakthrough Bandwagon Books." />
