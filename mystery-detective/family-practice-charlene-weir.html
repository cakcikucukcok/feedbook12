  <title>Family Practice - Charlene Weir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Chief of Police Susan Wren, investigating a homicide comes with the territory, but when a young friend gets caught in the crossfire, the former big-city cop&#39;s routine work becomes a personal mission. &lt;br&gt;When Dr. Dorothy, the dictatorial eldest sister of the five Barringtons (four of whom are doctors practicing together), is shot in her office, the greater part of the tragedy is the critical wounding of the most vulnerable innocent bystander--eleven-year-old Jen Bryan. To make it worse for Susan Wren, Jen was in her care that weekend, while her mother was out of town. &lt;br&gt;As with any homicide investigation, Susan begins her search for the killer with the victim&#39;s family, and finds that looks can be deceiving when it comes to the successful, respected Barringtons. Once the facade of a proud and unified family is shattered by Dr. Dorothy&#39;s murder, a Pandora&#39;s box is opened, and the little Kansas community is plunged into fear and danger. At the center is Susan Wren, never quite accepted in her police job as a woman and an outsider; now with double reason to find and stop the killer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
