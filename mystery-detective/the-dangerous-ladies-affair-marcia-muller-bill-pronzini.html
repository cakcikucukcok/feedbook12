  <title>The Dangerous Ladies Affair - Marcia Muller, Bill Pronzini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the firm of  Carpenter and Quincannon, Professional  Detective Services, stopping extortionists  is not only grand, but excitingly lucrative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a pleasant afternoon&#39;s bicycling through Golden Gate Park with a friend ends with the revelation of threatening letters, followed by a gunshot in a mansion garden, Sabina Carpenter knows this is a case that demands her immediate and undivided attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions her partner John Quincannon has to unravel are not difficult: Wrixton, a wealthy banker, has met his extortionist&#39;s first demand, but the order to pay another $5,000 is too much to face.  The banker&#39;s real problem is something he doesn&#39;t want to reveal.  That was fine with the detective, and when  he was informed that some private letters were involved and Wrixton absolutely needed them back, there was nothing more Quincannon needed in the way of background.  As with so many of San Francisco&#39;s elite, the bedroom doors never seemed to stay shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the easy part; far more difficult was the matter of the dead courier, murdered  most foully in a locked room within a locked room, creating a trail that will take John Quincannon through  most of San Francisco&#39;s less savory places and end with a riverboat trip that is anything but a relaxing cruise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Dangerous Ladies Affair &lt;/i&gt;is the next thrilling installment in this charming historical mystery series from MWA Grand Masters Marcia Muller and Bill Pronzini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Carpenter and Quincannon Mysteries:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;The Bughouse Affair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#2 &lt;i&gt;The Spook Lights Affair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#3 &lt;i&gt;The Body Snatchers Affair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#4 &lt;i&gt;The Plague of Thieves Affair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#5&lt;i&gt; The Dangerous Ladies Affair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;#6 &lt;i&gt;The Bags of Tricks Affair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
