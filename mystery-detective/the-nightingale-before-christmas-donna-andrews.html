  <title>The Nightingale Before Christmas - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the holidays draw near in Caerphilly, Mother volunteers to take part in in a big Christmas-themed decorator show house--each room of a temporarily untenanted house is decorated to the hilt by a different decorator for the public to tour.  Of course, Mother insists that Meg pitch in with the organization, and she finds herself surrounded by flamboyant personalities with massive egos clashing and feeling their professional reputations are at stake.  Then the rooms start to be sabotaged, and an unfortunate designer turns up dead--making Mother a prime suspect.  Can Meg catch the real killer in time to save Mother the indignity of arrest?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brilliantly funny and talented Donna Andrews delivers another winner in the acclaimed avian-themed series that mystery readers have come to love. Cozies make excellent stocking-stuffers, and &lt;i&gt;The Nightingale Before Christmas&lt;/i&gt; is guaranteed to put the &quot;ho ho hos&quot; into the holidays for the legions of fans hungry for another Christmas book featuring Meg Langslow. Donna has won many awards for this very popular series, and continues to come up with new hilarious adventures for her endearing heroine. The novel is full of superb screwball comedy as well as Donna&#39;s trademark crisp plotting, not to mention bushels of holiday cheer--it wouldn&#39;t be the most wonderful time of the year without it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
