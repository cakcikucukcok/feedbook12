  <title>The Broken Past - Christopher C. Gibbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A murder mystery quietly unfolds during a seemingly peaceful morning in Corinth, Missouri in 1923. Police Chief James Buckner is called away from his office to investigate the death of a prominent local businessman whose lifeless body has just been found. Several miles away, a black man is discovered lynched and in his pocket is a warning from the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;P&gt;
The Roaring 20s is a time when racial turmoil abounds in America. In Corinth, the black community, led by gambler and saloon keeper Elroy Dutton, are arming themselves for protection. Meanwhile, federal agent Joel Casterline is hot on the trail of local moonshiners, word leaks out that a gang of bank robbers is headed for Corinth, and someone is sending nasty Christmas cards to local widows. Chief Buckner becomes overwhelmed as the town government demands he stifle local crime, but simultaneously questions his decision to hire black police officers. To top it off, a group of local businessmen believes Buckner should enforce moral conduct and the county sheriff has his eye on a seat in the state legislature instead of on helping Buckner. &lt;P&gt;
Chief Buckner and his inexperienced police force must somehow find their way out of a dangerous crossfire that could leave Corinth&#39;s future in jeopardy." />
