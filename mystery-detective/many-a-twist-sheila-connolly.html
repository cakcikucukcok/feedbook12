  <title>Many a Twist - Sheila Connolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Pub owner Maura Donovan hasn’t seen her mother for over twenty years, so when she suddenly shows up in Maura’s pub, Maura’s not sure what to expect. Her mother is trying to find a life for herself back home and has taken up a position working with the new owners of the Crann Mor hotel just outside Skibbereen. Until her new boss is found dead in the gardens, dumped down the hillside behind the hotel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, trying to rekindle the relationship they’ve lost, Maura must investigate in order to clear her mother’s name. It’s not so easy though, as long-time residents of County Cork, including the families of her employee Mick, and the family of the deceased hotel owner, have bottled deep dark family secrets not meant to be uncorked. And someone will kill to keep them that way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How far would you go to protect your family? Maura tests the age-old question in &lt;i&gt;Many a Twist&lt;/i&gt;, the charming and atmospheric sixth County Cork mystery from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sheila Connolly.&lt;/div&gt;" />
