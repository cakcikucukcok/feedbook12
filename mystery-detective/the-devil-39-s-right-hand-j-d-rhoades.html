  <title>The Devil&#39;s Right Hand - J.D. Rhoades</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The critically-acclaimed debut novel by J.D. Rhoades, and the introduction of iconic bounty hunter Jack Keller. Keller is a man tormented by the nightmares he&#39;s had ever since a disastrous tour in Desert Storm. Destroyed by his experience, Keller now makes his living tracking bailjumpers for H&amp;H, a North Carolina bail bonds company run by a reclusive, beautiful, and horribly scarred woman named Angela. In truth, Keller doesn&#39;t work bail enforcement to live, he lives to work: the only thing that breaks through the numbness is the thrill of the hunt, the sound of gunfire, the high that comes with each successful takedown.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When H&amp;H is required to track down a lifelong loser for jumping bail on a routine burglary collar, Keller has no idea how gravely events are about to spiral out of his control. He chases his quarry straight into the center of a firestorm involving a pair of local Indians blinded by rage and hell-bent to avenge their father&#39;s murder. Along the way they encounter a vicious North Carolina cop with a mean streak and very few moral boundaries. Not to mention the cop&#39;s beautiful partner Marie, caught between a newfound desire for the just-on-the-edge-of-the-law Jack Keller and her loyalty to a police department with a serious ethics problem.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These people, each hurtling forward on their own individual trajectories of self-destruction, begin to intersect each other&#39;s lives in a series of volatile, escalating, and deadly events. Furiously paced and filled with unforgettable, masterfully drawn characters destined to meet in a bloody showdown which most of them will not survive, The Devil&#39;s Right Hand is a stylish, razor-edged debut novel that redefines the rules of the Southern thriller.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
