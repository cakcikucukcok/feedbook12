  <title>The Silent Ones - William Brodrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Monk-turned-lawyer-turned-novelist  William Brodrick has proven with each new installment of his Father Anselm  series that he&#39;s the &quot;writer of choice for those who prefer a cerebral  challenge with a moral and social message+? (Crime  Review). In The Silent Ones,  Brodrick tackles head-on the topical and sensitive social issue that&#39;s become  the modern scourge of the Church to create an intricate thriller that&#39;s as  devastating as it is impactful. Father Anselm is enlisted to trace the missing Father  Livermore, an American priest with a troubled past. His disappearance is  undoubtedly connected to allegations made against him by the family of  eleven-year-old Harry Brandwell, but a mysterious visitor to  the Priory urges Father Anselm to find out why Harry is prepared to blame an  innocent man.Â Father  Anselm finds himself on the trail of an imposter, unaware that he is being  drawn into the shadows of a mysterious conspiracy, his reputation for integrity  exploited by those closest to him, and behind the victim there also stand the  ranks of the Silent Ones--those who have chosen silence as a way to face their  own horrors--who also seek justice.Contemporary, disturbing, and  elegantly plotted, The Silent Ones is  a compelling novel about the anatomy of silence, the courage of victims, and  the redemptive power of public justice.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
