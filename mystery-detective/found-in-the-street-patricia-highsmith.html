  <title>Found in the Street - Patricia Highsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#147;Fabulous, in all senses of that word . . . combining the best features of the suspense genre with the best of existential fiction&amp;#151;a thrilled reflection.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Paul Theroux&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Elsie Tyler turns heads wherever she goes. After leaving her hometown upstate for Greenwich Village, the charming young waitress soon finds herself surrounded by admirers, including Jack and Natalia Sutherland, a married couple who invite Elsie into their bohemian inner circle and help her launch a career as a model. Meanwhile, Ralph Linderman, a middle-aged security guard with a dog named God, is nursing his own obsession with Elsie. He sets out to protect her from the &amp;#147;bad company&amp;#8221; she attracts, but his uninvited affections are overbearing, possibly even pathological. When Ralph finds Jack&amp;#8217;s wallet on a morning stroll through the Village, and returns it, he is entirely unprepared for the complex maze of sexual obsession and disturbing psychological intrigue he is about to be drawn into.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Originally published in 1986, &lt;I&gt;Found in the Street&lt;/I&gt; is classic Highsmith&amp;#151;an engrossing, unsettling thriller that explores the bleakest alleyways of human desire, and a kaleidoscopic portrait of 1980s New York City. Patricia Highsmith, author of &lt;I&gt;Strangers on a Train&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Talented Mr. Ripley&lt;/I&gt;, has been called &amp;#147;one of the finest crime novelists&amp;#8221; by the &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; and is now considered one of the most original voices in twentieth-century American fiction.&lt;/div&gt;" />
