&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All men have certain desires... things they hope you say but don&amp;#39;t want to tell you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are you tired of feeling sexually inferior with THE MAN you want to please so badly and wish you could gain his approval without losing confidence in yourself?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In your mind, he should want you for you and be satisfied with the woman you are...experiencing your beautiful feminine essence and stay addicted to you as long as you want, with very little effort necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, for some reason, his attention and focus never seem to be on you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever wondered what some ladies do to make a man addicted to them and only them? Do you want to be such type of woman, the kind that a man adores and never want to leave for a second?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know the words he wants to hear so badly, the words that will make him always feel the same way he felt the first night you kissed him? Why not make him feel this way every day, by checking out the book, will you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
