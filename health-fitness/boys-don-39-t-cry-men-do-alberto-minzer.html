  <title>Boys Don&#39;t Cry; Men Do - Alberto Minzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every man had a dream of the kind of man they would one day become.  Have you become this man? Have you ever asked another man whether hes become who he always wanted to be?  Im surprised to find that for so many men their earliest dreams for themselves are just a hope for the future.    
This book is for men, and for everyone who cares about them.
We give up our dreams too easily.  Our personal growth stops. What  we dont know is that  were missing the connection of full emotional intimacy. Many of us havent been taught how to create that emotional intimacy and how to distinguish it from sexual intimacy. Without emotional intimacy and joy, men arent fully alive. What a tragedy that so many men are missing so much. 
The hope that motivated this book is that someday, all men will be able to reconnect with  lasting intimacy and joy that they can have with others, by reconnecting with the man they always wanted to be.  
The vision is that someday our boys will grow into the men they want to be, living out the deepest longings of their hearts.
It is my hope that this book will bring you or those around you closer to being the man you always dreamed of becoming." />
