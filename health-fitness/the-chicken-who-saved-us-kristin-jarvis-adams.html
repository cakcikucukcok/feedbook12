  <title>The Chicken Who Saved Us - Kristin Jarvis Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The true story of an autistic boy with a body under siege by mysterious illness, and the chicken who saved his life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Heartbreakingly beautiful &amp;#150; the gift of the human animal bond.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150; Temple Grandin, Author, researcher, consultant and world-renowned autism spokesperson&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eight-year-old Andrew was autistic and bilingual. He spoke English &amp;#150; and Chicken. But the day he told his pet chicken Frightful that his body was trying to kill him, Andrew&amp;#8217;s family and an entire medical community were launched into a decade-long quest for answers.  This honest memoir of fierce and faithful parenting takes readers on a heartfelt journey through chronic illness and Asperger&amp;#8217;s syndrome to discover the healing bond between a boy and his chicken. Navigating the complex landscape of modern medicine and genetics, through a rare diagnosis of Trisomy 8 Mosaicism and an experimental bone marrow transplant, readers venture to places where chickens talk, superheroes come alive, and a boy on the brink of death finds the courage to survive.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
