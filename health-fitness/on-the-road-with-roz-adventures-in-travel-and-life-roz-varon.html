  <title>On the Road with Roz: Adventures in Travel and Life - Roz Varon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the past eight years Chicago television Traffic Anchor Roz Varon has been recording her travels in words and images.&amp;nbsp; This book is designed to be a keepsake for those readers who enjoy vicarious adventures, and for those who seek ideas for their own trips across the U.S. and in foreign lands.&amp;nbsp; Written with honesty, enthusiasm, and a grateful sense of wonder, Roz and her family enlighten her audience with little known facts, humorous anecdotes, and heartwarming insights into her personal life. We are Roz&amp;rsquo;s awestruck travel companions at the inauguration of President Barack Obama, students of history while roaming the Jewish Deep South, and gleeful visitors to Walt Disney World - which our author considers &amp;ldquo;The Happiest Place on Earth.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we venture to other continents, we move through sacred places in Israel, joyous sites in Ireland, and legendary landmarks in the southern United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most fun we have with Roz and her family is the traveling the famous Route 66, a treasured Americana road trip that will surely have readers packing their maps and bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all appears sunny and careful in these pages, we also learn that Roz Varon is a more than 10-year&amp;nbsp; Metastatic Breast Cancer Survivor. This medical facts adds poignancy, courage, and inspiration for all those whose lives have been touched by the illness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
