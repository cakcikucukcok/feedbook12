  <title>Too Young to Be Angels - Shirley Delorbe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many of us have heard tragic stories of parents losing a child, but not many people could handle the abject grief of the deaths of three of their own children. &lt;I&gt;Too Young To Be Angels: An Ongoing Journey of Grief &lt;/I&gt;is the heart-wrenching story of one mother&#39;s climb from the pits of despair, grief, and depression after the deaths of three of her four children. &lt;p&gt;
Author Shirley Delorbe struggles to hold on to reality when death seems to become a way of life. After her six-year-old son Randall&#39;s death in 1964 from acute trachea bronchitis, the road to recovery is long and hard. The question &quot;Why me?&quot; nags at Delorbe&#39;s subconscious. Her heart is only beginning to heal when her daughter Victoria&#39;s brutal murder four years later shocks the family. Almost at the breaking point, Delorbe fights simply to breathe as the death of her son Gerry in a motorcycle accident drags her back into hell a few years later. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Too Young To Be Angels &lt;/I&gt;recounts Delorbe&#39;s journey as she struggles with the loss of each child, reveals her every thought, and shares how she eventually developed her ten steps to recovery.&lt;p&gt;" />
