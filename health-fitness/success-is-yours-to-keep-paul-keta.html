  <title>Success Is Yours to Keep - Paul Keta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Come to think of it...everyone wants some level of success in their lives but unfortunately just wanting the success will not get the job done. Becoming successful and prosperous in life is not an automatic process.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do not remain ignorant about this. The Lord said &quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge&quot;. When things are going wrong in our lives and we don&#39;t achieve the success we desire we are quick to focus our energies on blaming Satan yet Satan simply takes advantage of the ignorance of humans so that he can lure or tempt these humans into destruction. The above biblical quote is also supported by a management principle that says &quot;What you do not know you cannot manage and what you cannot manage you cannot control&quot;. So if you don&#39;t know who you are, or what the reason for your existence here on Earth is, or what is that you want your future life to look like then it will take a miracle to achieve the life that you may call prosperous. It is next to impossible for a journey of any human life to be successsful if run on autopilot. It takes knowledge about who you are and it also takes reams of effort and passion to take your life to your desired level of success.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Millions of people in the world are stressed, frustrated, disillusioned, demotivated and suffer a lot of pain simply because they do not know where their life or that of their business is going. If you happen to be one of those feeling lost and disillusioned about life and would like to turn such a situation into success, then I strongly recommend that you read this book &quot;Success Is Yours to Keep&quot; that provides practical guidance to discovery of your unique journey to success and prosperity.&lt;/P&gt;" />
