  <title>Never Give up . . . All Is Well - David W. Hime</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What motivated me to write this book was to tell you about my life experiences in conquering horrific health problems and physical adversity covering over five decades of my lifetime. Before my fathers death in March 2006, he had also encouraged me to write my life story to inspire others who face seemingly insurmountable odds, outrageous misfortune, and overwhelming physical adversity by declaring that nothing is impossible for God to perform miracles for those who believe and trust in Him. My mothers words still ring in my ears: David, you may give in when the going gets tough, but you never give up. That statement has resonated in my mind throughout my lifetime to give me comfort and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;" />
