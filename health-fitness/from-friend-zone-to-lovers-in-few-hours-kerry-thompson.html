  <title>From Friend Zone to Lovers in Few Hours - Kerry Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
The pain of being stuck in the friend zone is one of the worst pain anyone would ever feel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is like being hungry, and in front of you is your favourite meal, but for some weird reasons, you are not able to grab it and satisfy your cravings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Worst still, someone else comes along and grab what is rightfully yours and stuff it all into their mouths while you watch in unspeakable agony.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In fact, what I just explained above doesn&amp;#39;t even come close to&lt;br /&gt;
explaining how bad the friend zone situation really is..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is a case of a monkey doing all the hard, heavy lifting, while the baboon strolls to the podium to take all the glory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You love her, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know you do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But she can&amp;#39;t see it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what you do, she just can&amp;#39;t picture you as the man in her life?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I know all these because I have been in that painful ditch a lot of times in the distant past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was before I learned how to grab hold of the psychological steering wheels of a &amp;nbsp;woman&amp;#39;s mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when I finally did, O boy, I just knew exactly what to do every time, to become the only man, they want to love all their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And today, after you read this book, you will find out what I &amp;nbsp;know now, that has helped me get the girls I really liked, to like me back 100 times, more than I liked them..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Get out of the friend zone while you still have the chance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is your one-way ticket out of there..&lt;br /&gt;
