  <title>There Is No Good Card for This - Dr. Kelsey Crowe, Emily McDowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The creator of the viral hit &quot;Empathy Cards&quot; teams up with a compassion expert to produce a visually stunning and groundbreaking illustrated guide to help you increase your emotional intelligence and learn how to offer comfort and support when someone you know is in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone you know is hurting, you want to let her know that you care. But many people don&amp;#8217;t know what words to use&amp;#8212;or are afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. This thoughtful, instructive guide, from empathy expert Dr. Kelsey Crowe and greeting card maverick Emily McDowell, blends well-researched, actionable advice with the no-nonsense humor and the signature illustration style of McDowell&#39;s immensely popular Empathy Cards, to help you feel confident in connecting with anyone experiencing grief, loss, illness, or any other difficult situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in a how-to, relatable, we&amp;#8217;ve-all-been-that-deer-in-the-headlights kind of way, &lt;em&gt;There Is No Good Card for This&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t a spiritual treatise on how to make you a better person or a scientific argument about why compassion matters. It is a helpful illustrated guide to effective compassion that takes you, step by step by step, past the paralysis of thinking about someone in a difficult time to actually doing something (or nothing) with good judgment instead of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There Is No Good Card for This&lt;/em&gt; features workbook exercises, sample dialogs, and real-life examples from Dr. Crowe&amp;#8217;s research, including her popular &quot;Empathy Bootcamps&quot; that give people tools for building relationships when it really counts. Whether it&amp;#8217;s a coworker whose mother has died, a neighbor whose husband has been in a car accident, or a friend who is seriously ill, &lt;em&gt;There Is No Good Card for This&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to be the best friend you can be to someone in need. &lt;/p&gt;" />
