  <title>Thoughts from the Inside Out - Adrienne Lirio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Thoughts from the Inside Out&lt;/i&gt; presents author Adrienne Lirios journey of self-discovery and self-realization on an emotional level. This collection of poetry and prose, the latter in the form of rants, may offer depictions of yourself or someone close to you. We all share a commonality in our human frailties and hopes, although each of us experiences these things differently. 
From this journey, youll gain a new understanding of your personal feelingsand solid proof that youre not alone in these feelings. More importantly, with some insights and introspection, you can choose to move on and create a new and decidedly happier chapter in your life.
&lt;i&gt;Having sat upon the razors edge on many occasions for a variety of reasons feeling alone in my own misery, I decided to be proactive about its relief. 
I decided to write down my internal observations in the hopes it would bring insight and understanding. I chose to express these observations in two formats: poetry and what I call rant.
After sharing my own views with others, it became all too clear that many of you are adrift in your own inner turmoil. I hope that I can help you understand that you are not alone in your confusion.&lt;/i&gt;" />
