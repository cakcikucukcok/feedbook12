  <title>Chandigarh to Chapel Hill - Vaneep Sandhu, Ellen Casey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chandigarh is a city in northern India; Chapel Hill is a town in North Carolina. Chandigarh to Chapel Hill is a story of one womans growth and change as she follows her husband from the first town to the second. Just as her marriage is falling apart, she finds herself confronting a new and challenging culture, and to make things more complicated, she suddenly meets a seductive stranger. With no other options, she must look within herself and find a way to balance her Indian values with the American independence she desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;www.facebook.com/ChandigarhToChapelHill&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first novel  weaves a touching story  It captures the conflict between two cultures and the journey of the young woman navigating her way between the two  It is a story of many marriages, of many immigrant lives, [and] the Punjab/Sikh element [is] brought in, in an effortless and natural way.  The sincerity and the honesty of the story make [reading it] a gripping experience.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Pritam Singh, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabreena&#39;s journey across oceans and cultures will resonate with anyone who has taken a chance on life and love.&lt;br /&gt;Laura Boyes, film curator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;An evocative story  with the delicate fragrance of chai tea from India and the bracing scent of strong American coffee. [Sandhu&#39;s] characters are warm and complex, [and] Sabreena&#39;s journey from naive graduate student in India to  empowered US divorcee and career woman is very engaging  The immigrant&#39;s experience and the inevitable hiccups of culture are relayed with elegance and grace. This is an important story for anyone interested in understanding the immigrant experience and the formation of new cultural identities.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;Chris Cartwright, EdD &lt;br /&gt;Director of Intercultural Assessment,&lt;br /&gt;Intercultural Communication Institute&lt;/p&gt;" />
