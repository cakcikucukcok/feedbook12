  <title>100 No-Equipment Workouts Vol. 1: Fitness Routines you can do anywhere, Any Time - Neila Rey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 100 Workouts Book&lt;/strong&gt; is for everyone who wants to stay active, get fit, build muscle tone and/or shed extra weight in the home environment without acquiring any extra equipment. Be in complete control of your fitness. No more worrying about the right equipment, the right attire, finding a gym, or finding the space or time to exercise. The 100 no-equipment fitness routines in this jumbo A4-size workout book will let you:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Exercise on your terms&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Get fit with the time you have&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Have fun while getting fitter&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Stop worrying about the gym culture&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Find a routine to do whether you are an absolute beginner or someone already fit.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Different workouts will ensure that your muscles don&amp;#39;t get used to the same regime, giving you more in return, and also help you stay active and not get bored with the same routine. Some of the workouts are more challenging and some are easier than others so you will never get bored. All have three different levels you can try them at, so there is always something to aim for.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Easy-to-follow visual routines guide you through the workout, as you go from one exercise to the next, in an easier fashion than in a video. Just follow the routine and have fun! You don&amp;#39;t have to work through the entire book; you can pick the workouts you like most or randomly select one and make it a workout of the day. Ideally you want to do 3-4 workouts per week.&lt;/p&gt;" />
