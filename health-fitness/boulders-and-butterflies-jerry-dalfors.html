  <title>Boulders and Butterflies - Jerry Dalfors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Boulders and Butterflies is intended to help young men and women who have a desire to discover and experience that deeper sensual component in each of us begging for attention, yet continued social pressure suppresses.  A sensual relationship goes far deeper than the mere appearance and social prestige that appears to be happiness.  Men are forced to be macho warriors from birth.  Women continue to be harassed for being to emotional and similarly are being forced to suppress the true woman she is.  Unleashing the true sensual being is what it takes to experience heaven on earth.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Book Review&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dalfors confirmed and gave words to thoughts, experiences, and feelings I have developed over a lifetime of lovers.  Now in my sixties, I wish I had understood the distinction between sexuality and genuine erotic, spiritual sensuality when I was much younger.  But, I am constantly grateful that I get it now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is it?  I have finally come to realize that, as Dalfors expresses it, I much prefer the intimacy of emotional love making rather than the athletic, physical performance of the same act.  (144)  I have learned that foreplay and afterglow ALWAYS enhance a sexual experience and that the route to my greatest satisfaction it to totally concentrate and immerse myself in the satisfaction of my partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I suspect that most women will read this book and think, thats what I want.  Men who read it, and get it will realize, thats what Ive been missing.
