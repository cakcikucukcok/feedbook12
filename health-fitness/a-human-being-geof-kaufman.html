  <title>A Human... Being - Geof Kaufman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whats your name?&lt;br /&gt;
Xander. Whats yours?&lt;br /&gt;
Im Serenity, she said, sipping her drink.&lt;br /&gt;
Serenity. What a perfect name, Xander thought.&lt;br /&gt;
He looked again at the tranquil blue energy cloud&lt;br /&gt;
surrounding her. His own cloud was similar to hers in that it was&lt;br /&gt;
mostly blue, but it contained hints of other colors at times. His also moved slowly, but not as slowly or as gracefully as Serenitys.&lt;br /&gt;
So, you can see them, too, she stated.&lt;br /&gt;
Energy clouds? Yes, I can see them, too, he answered,&lt;br /&gt;
breaking his stare at her cloud.&lt;br /&gt;
He remembered her admitting to seeing his energy cloud&lt;br /&gt;
when they first met at the pool ten years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
She probably doesnt even remember me from there, he&lt;br /&gt;
thought, but maybe she does from the ice cream shop. That was only a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
I do remember you. We saw each other at the pool and at the ice cream shop.&lt;br /&gt;
Xander could feel his heart beating hard in his chest.&lt;br /&gt;
Did she just read my thoughts? he wondered.&lt;br /&gt;
Energy clouds. Hmm, Serenity said, pondering the term.&lt;br /&gt;
I like it but I call them auras.&lt;/p&gt;" />
