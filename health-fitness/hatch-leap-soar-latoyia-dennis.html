Hatch.
Before you can begin to change and start realizing your potential, you are in your comfort zone inside your shell. When you begin the process of hatching, you&#39;re defying the norm, pressing past your fears to break free. Once you&#39;ve hatched, you can see the possibilities. You are now open to doing what you were created to do, being what you were created to be. You start to think, &quot;Oh my gosh, as soon as I get out of here I can go over there and I can do this,&quot; because now you can see it. But in order to get out of your shell, you will have to make a...
Leap. 
This might be a leap of faith. This could be a leap in a completely different direction than you&#39;ve ever gone before. You have to move out of your current position, out of whatever comfort zone or shell you are in. It&#39;s important to have faith that you are better freed from your shell than you are stuck inside its borders.
In order to reach the potential God has given you, you must move toward it. Things won’t come to you sitting in your shell. Opportunities and change won’t happen if you are sitting still. You have to leap or jump or move forward to experience what God wants for you.
A bird never learns to fly by staying in the nest. A bird has to leap out in order to learn to…
Soar. 
Once you learn to fly, you can fly high and soar. You can reach your potential." />
