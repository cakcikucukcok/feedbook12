  <title>Memories in Dragonflies - Lannette Cornell Bloom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life—and death—may be hard; but joy is simple. 
&lt;br&gt;
Lannette Cornell Bloom, a typical, overworked nurse, wife, and mom of two, was forty-three when her mother was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. She quit her job and dove headlong into the familiar role of caretaking. This choice—to slow down and be present for the hardest year of her life—resulted in an awakening. In unexpected moments, as childhood memories flooded into the present, Lannette glimpsed bits of magic that existed just beyond the pain. Without knowing it, she was experiencing a mindful dying process with her mother—and it was a journey that would change the way she lived the rest of her life.
&lt;br&gt;
A touching and soulful memoir that gracefully uncovers the beauty that is often lost within the dying process, &lt;em&gt;Memories in Dragonflies&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful portrait of what it means to be human and a gentle reminder to enjoy every moment, because even the simplest ones bring lasting joy." />
