  <title>Where the Rivers Run Deep - L.R. Holder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AND IN THE FACE OF ALL DISENCHANTMENT AND BROKEN DREAMS SHE MUST PREVAIL. 
      In the quest for a career, a good life but more importantly to protect her own children from the trickery of life itself ; One full of disappointments and psychological trauma and one that could  mirror hers, she vows to provide for them in every way and to help them achieve their own potentials. She must conquer all adversities on her journey but fears of the unknown and what lies ahead has driven her to the point of obsession, until the only person she now fears is herself.
     Beaten and bruised, penniless, homeless and at times feeling worthless she must persevere, face each new day with a smile although she is screaming on the inside and is almost  almost, just thoughts away from giving up. 
     But she is determined to put up a fight; one that will see her through and even when she is knocked down, when the pain seems unbearable, when there are no more tears left, she must go on. She would not be defeated, gathering strength from her passion and ambition and from the prayers of her dear mother; she gets up after each knock back, dust herself off, stand tall and is ready to take on next challenge or obstacle SURE to come her way.      
The Victoria Regia Lily is the national Flower of Guyana." />
