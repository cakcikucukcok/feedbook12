  <title>A Woman’S Guide to the Male Mind - Sam Geraldo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Womans Guide to the Male Mind is the indirect result of a blog that I wrote in 2005  How Do You Tell If a Guy Fancies You?  The article was so popular, receiving more than 70 replies from women with lots more questions, that I launched my web site www.seducemen.co.uk.  Since then, most of the advice Ive given in hundreds of published articles was based on my own experiences and those of my friends. 
To write the book, however, I adopted a more scientific approach.  I performed a significant amount of research into recent discoveries by anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists and biochemists on topics ranging from basic sexual attraction to personality type and male/female communications strategies.  Its my belief, therefore, that A Womans Guide to the Male Mind features the best of two worlds: common sense opinions backed by solid empirical evidence.
By helping ladies understand the male point of view with regard to sex, dating and relationships; I hope to eliminate the senseless conflicts that so often erupt between lovers and would-be lovers. Once you understand a few fundamentals about the male mind and male behaviour, you will stop thinking of men as inscrutable blockheads and primitive misfits. You will no longer regard them as you would a small, nasty child  or an alien race. Arming yourself with the wisdom in this book, youll increase your odds of finding happiness and harmony in romantic relationships, and you will help ensure that this bliss lasts a lifetime.
By the time a man reaches maturity, he has passed through four evolutionary stages in his attitude toward women and relationships. Its very important to understand  and identify  these four stages, because it will save you from wasting time on guys who arent ready for serious romance." />
