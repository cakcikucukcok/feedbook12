  <title>The Senior Hood Struggling - Diana Harvey Darrisaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;Hello, seniorhood. A large percentage of us are fighting to stay healthy and happy. In order to truly understand the fight for health, one has to be a part of the fight. Believe me, I am. I have found a way to be healthy and happy without stress. As you fold the pages back in this book, I hope the topics discussed will offer compassion and understanding; a time to look back for some, with a warm smile, motivation, and strength for all. The topics include diabetes, cardiovascular health and other health conditions, how eating correctly is important, and how illnesses do connect with healthy meal planning. Understanding sugars, sodium, fats, and cholesterol is also crucial. Do you understand how to read food labels? Read how a member of the seniorhood tries hard every day to turn the unhappy days around to happier ones in dealing with her illnesses. The majority of our conditions in health we share together. Are there correct and incorrect ways to eat with certain health conditions? The answers are available right inside this book. How extremely important and necessary is your medical staff? Depression in the elderly is very much alive. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

We are strangers to one another, but not in our fight. Take what you read and mold it into a determination not to give up. These are our golden and silver years; they belong to us. No one else can feel what we feel or have the wonderful memories we have locked in our lives. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
