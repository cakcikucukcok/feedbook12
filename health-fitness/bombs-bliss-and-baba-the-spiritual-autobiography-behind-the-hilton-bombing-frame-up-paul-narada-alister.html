  <title>Bombs, Bliss and Baba: The Spiritual Autobiography Behind the Hilton Bombing Frame Up - Paul Narada Alister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1978 Paul Alister was a 22-year old volunteer with the global organisation Ananda Marga, dedicating his life to meditation and social service. In one terrifying night, through the work of a spy and the secretyy police, he was named one of Australia&amp;#39;s top terrorists and framed for conspiracy to murder and linked with the notorious Hilton Bombing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;For seven years, Alister and his two co-accused faced the tyranny of prison life while they fought to clear their names against blatant injustice. They were finally released and given a complete government pardon in 1985.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; In this fascinating autobiography Alister tells the inside story behind one of Australia&amp;#39;s best known but least understood cases. Far more than a legal thriller, this story details his relentless search for spirituality, contact with his amazing spiritual master, Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, and the profound power of the meditation that sustained hismental peace through unimaginable hardships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; This uplifting account shows how the author transformed extreme adversity into spirtual strength. With honesty, humour and insight, Alister turns an extraordinary life into an unforgettable story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
