  <title>From Mindfulness to Heartfulness - Dr. Alane Daugherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most of us live our lives worn out with stress, anxiety, and emotional chaos. Moreover, the law of adaptations shows us that the more we experience any internal state, the more it becomes the operating system of our life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Mindfulness to Heartfulness offers another path. It invites you on your own transformative journey to live life at your fullest capacity. It will show you how you have become who you are, and it will offer you a blueprint for change. It will show you how heartfulness, embodied, calms the threat and fear that so often consumes you, and it will offer you a step-by-step approach to one of calm and connection, including a loving connection with yourself. It will show you that love, compassion, and connection are trainable and allow you to tap into your deepest potential. It will show you that healing is possible through heartfulness for yourself, and it will demonstrate the transformative power of every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built on the foundations of mindfulness, you will experience the miracle of heartfulness. This miracle emerges when we seek and actively engage in whatever life-generating opportunity each moment holds. When we fully embody heartfulness, our bodies transform, our lives transform, and the whole of our existence transforms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
