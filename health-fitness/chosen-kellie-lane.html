  <title>Chosen - Kellie Lane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    Have you ever wondered what your true purpose is in life? What are you passionate about? What are your gifts and talents? If you could walk out of your job
    today, what would you pursue? Do you feel that something is missing, but you cant quite put your finger on what it is? Perhaps you have the fine job and
    the house on the hill, but there is a yearning in your heart for something else that you really cant explain. Maybe you have very little, yet you can
    sense that greatness is buried within you. How do you activate it?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    If youve ever pondered any of these questions, Chosen may be the missing piece to your lifes puzzle. Allow Life Coach Dr. Kellie Lane to guide you to the
    place within you where your true riches lie. Through Bible study and life application, Dr. Lane confirms that you are not here by happenstance. There is an
    assignment for your life, and the time has come for you to discover it. Yes, you can dream again! Yes, you can live a life that is happy and fulfilled!
    Chosen will empower you to be all about your Fathers business.
