  <title>Searching for Real Love? - Queen E. Lacey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Queen is the author of Its Not About Religion, God Wants A Relationship and From My Heart to Yours.   As in all Queens books, they are a collection of poems to encourage the reader to not just see themselves as a Christian or being religious, but to know they have a covenant relationship with God through His Son, Jesus Christ. When you are in a covenant relationship, things can&#39;t just come in to break that covenant.  No one person is perfect, so you will make mistakes and/or bad choices.  This should not disqualify you from love.  The poems in this book are based off of real life situations.  The author, Queen E. Lacey, wants you to know that nothing will separate you from God&#39;s love.  
As in Queens other books, she shared her personal life stores through An Open Book Moment.  In this book those moments reflect the search for love.  Unfortunately, that search took her in and out of different beds.  Through her writings, Queen is very open about her life experiences.   As she allows you to journey through her life, her one desire is that everyone would know that God&#39;s love outweighs any bad choices anyone may have made in life.  As you read through the different poems and are able to identify yourself through them, know that you too are still loved by God and nothing can separate you from that love.  
Queen E. Lacey was born and raised in White Plains, N.Y. and now resides in Phoenix, AZ. Queen is currently a member of the Church of the Remnant, under the leadership of Pastors Warren H. Stewart, Jr. and Chrystal Stewart in Phoenix, AZ.  There she works with the pastors aid, card ministry, prison ministry (soon to start), and any outreach going forward.  At Remnant we dont wait on titles to be given, we see the need so we get to work." />
