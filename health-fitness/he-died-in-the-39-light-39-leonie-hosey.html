  <title>He Died in the &#39;Light&#39; - Leonie Hosey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2005, Warren Hosey was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The prognosis was ominous. His doctors told him to get his affairs in order without wasting time. However, they didnt count on his wife, Leonie, and her gift. Leonie is a medium who has received through her channelling a healing method known as Golden Ray Healing. Even though Warren had always been a non-believer, his options were running out. As well as undergoing conventional medical treatment, he allowed Leonie to treat him using Golden Ray Healing. For the next three years, he astounded his doctors by keeping his aggressive tumours at bay. When he finally passed, he asked Leonie to write their story and call it How I Helped My Husband Die.  Leonie chose to call it He Died in the Light  A Love Story as a tribute to Warrens transformation from spiritual sceptic to someone who believed in the power of healing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Warren Hosey was a charismatic, glamorous man with a huge appetite for all that life brought his way. Leonie is a gifted medium and natural therapist. She helped to develop Shell and Coral Essences and now teaches Golden Ray Healing to those wishing to heal themselves and their loved ones. This is their story  a love story." />
