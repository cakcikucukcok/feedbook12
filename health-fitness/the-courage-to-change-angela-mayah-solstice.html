  <title>The Courage To Change - Angela Mayah Solstice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I look back on my life I can see how I have always been trying to change it. I&#39;ve always tried to do the right thing but always seemed to find myself in a place of emergency, chaos, and heartbreak. Life had not been easy for me and I struggled often trying to once again get back onto my feet. Honestly, I should not be here on Earth experiencing any sort of happiness or peace. There is nothing about my past or my story that would hint to the kind of woman I have evolved into today. I should be discouraged, broken, and lifeless, but I am not. I had the courage to change my life and my hope is that I can empower you to do the same. I believe that in everyone there lives a soul, filled with good intentions, creativity, and intuition. The Courage to change is my story of how I tapped into these virtues. I give you my story along with the exercises, readings, and affirmations I used to bring healing to my life. There is a call for people to share their message of healing and hope to help others. The Courage to Change is my answer to this call." />
