  <title>The Plan. Shop, Stock and Serve. - Jessica Tinkler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its easy to understand the concept of eating lean protein with vegetables to lose weight, but if you dont normally eat these foods and dont have the time to prepare them, following a diet is challenging. The Plan: Shop, Stock and Serve, not only addresses this issue head on, but it provides the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food is social. Its front and center when we get together with friends, family and loved ones. We celebrate with it, laugh with it and sometimes even cry with it. How can you expect to come off of lifes emotional rollercoaster without turning to Ben and Jerrys? Stuff happens! The dinner parties are not just going to stop. Your busy life will not just go away. In order to change the way you eat and drop those pounds for good, you need a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With The Plan:&lt;br /&gt;
* You wont have to follow a restrictive diet. Your plan is made for you, by you!&lt;br /&gt;
* All your favorite foods can go on your plan, and yes, you will still lose weight.&lt;br /&gt;
* You will only have to hit the grocery store once a week.&lt;br /&gt;
* For once, healthy eating will actually simplify your life.&lt;br /&gt;
* The Plan is something you can realistically do for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any book can tell you what to eat in order to lose weight. Implementing those changes into your lifestyle is the tricky part. Unlike any other book on the market, The Plan focuses on providing you with the right tools to get you from where you are now to where you want to be. Its the essential map to healthy eating and living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plan: Shop, Stock and Serve includes a cookbook with over 120 recipes, meal and snack ideas, as well as an exercise and activity guide with over 30 basic strength-training exercises that are easy to do at home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
