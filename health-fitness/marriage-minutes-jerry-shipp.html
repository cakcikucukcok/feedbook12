  <title>Marriage Minutes - Jerry Shipp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on his thirty years in the trenches as a marriage therapist and the knowledge and insight he has gained from thousands of clients, Jerry Shipp has written a book of practical and, sometimes, humorous parables to help us grow deeply satisfying marriages.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In our high-tech, chaotic world where relationships are shallow and people are more connected to their devices than to each other, it is difficult to know how to create a perfect marriage when there are so few good examples out there. How can we create love for a lifetime? Everybody wants it, but so few seem to achieve it. This book will give some answers to these burning questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In just two minutes a day, men, you will learn:&lt;/br&gt; 
 What Eeyore, Tarzan, the Grinch, Pepe Le Pew, and Captain Picard have to say about intimate relationships,&lt;/br&gt;
 How Jaws, 50 First Dates, Sherlock Holmes, Godzilla, and True Lies can help you to enjoy and improve your marriage,&lt;/br&gt;
 What Stupidville is and how not to go there,&lt;/br&gt;
 The proper way to pursue the woman you love, and&lt;/br&gt;
 How to overcome being a doofus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women, you will learn:&lt;/br&gt; 
 How to prevent drift,&lt;/br&gt;
 What unconditional respect, The Law of Association, and submission really mean,&lt;/br&gt;
 How to fight in a way that strengthens your marriage,&lt;/br&gt;
 What ordinary things like scabs, weeds, frogs, and back doors can teach you about your marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couples, if you apply the mostly simple (but not necessarily easy) suggestions in this book, you will have created a fabulous, enduring relationship&lt;/p&gt;" />
