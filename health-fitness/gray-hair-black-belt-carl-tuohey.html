  <title>Gray Hair, Black Belt - Carl Tuohey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&quot;Gray Hair, Black Belt&quot;&lt;/I&gt;, by Mr. Carl &quot;Cal&quot; Tuohey, describes one elderly-ish persons experience during a series of Tae Kwon Do classes.  While geared toward those over the age of 50, this book will help anyone that has thought about taking a martial arts class and provides hilarious details on what to expect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The book is divided into two parts.  Part I describes the inner workings of a Tae Kwon Do class as seen through the author&#39;s comedic eyes.  Mr. Tuohey begins by explaining his decision to start Tae Kwon Do at such a late stage in life.  It ends with Mr. Tuohey taking you through his Black Belt testing and earning his Black Belt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The book covers topics such as &quot;The Class Format&quot;, &quot;Sparring&quot; and &quot;Belt Ranks&quot;.  It also provides descriptions for the various Korean terms used in class, and the patterns necessary to reach each belt level.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
While taking the classes, Mr. Tuohey contributed articles to the school&#39;s monthly newsletter.  Part II of his book is a compilation of those light hearted fun-to-read articles.  They reflect an exaggerated viewpoint of what Mr. Tuohey saw and experienced during his classes, told as only Mr. Tuohey can." />
