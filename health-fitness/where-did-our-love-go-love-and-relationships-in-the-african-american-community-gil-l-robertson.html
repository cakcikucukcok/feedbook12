  <title>Where Did Our Love Go: Love and Relationships in the African-American Community - Gil L. Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Where Did Our Love Go?&lt;/I&gt;, an anthology of essays written by many major public figures and celebrities, will explore the substantive issues related to marital problem in the African-American community. From the &quot;my baby&#39;s mama&quot; syndrome to the more serious implications of what a generation of single-parent households will mean to future generations, this comprehensive collection will provide an in-depth discourse on the trends and issues that have caused the problematic behaviors within African-American relationships to persist with little sign of relief. The book will consist of a total of 40 essays divided equally into 4 lifestyle categories (single, married, divorced, and widowed), to present a wide cross section of perspectives on this subject.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Marriage plays an essential role in maintaining the vitality and character of a community, so it is deeply unsettling for many African Americans to find that the value of this institution has lost its allure. While marriage among African Americans has always fallen below the average of other population segments, the gap today has grown so pronounced that the subject has sparked an intense national dialogue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A 2006 &lt;I&gt;Washington Post&lt;/I&gt; article, &amp;#147;Is Marriage for White People,&amp;#8221; created waves of controversy on the issue. In 2010, Nightline dedicated an entire broadcast to this growing crisis. The marriage gap in Black America has become such an open secret that it&amp;#8217;s now the source of endless bad jokes and prime time reality shows. The statistics even back this up, as according to the U.S. Census, 43.3% of black men and 41.9% of black women in America have never been married, and the rate of decline is nearly twice the national average.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Marriage is a rite of passage that is fundamental to every culture, which underscores the tremendous need for an active dialogue to take place that will lay a foundation for discovery. With essays from 50 Cent, Viola Davis, Jabari Asim, Darnell Williams, Faith Evans, Mara Brock Akil, and more, &lt;I&gt;Where Did Our Love Go?&lt;/I&gt; will ignite the fight for that conversation to begin.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
