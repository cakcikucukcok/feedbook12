  <title>Beware of the Signs - Lee Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This was something that happened to other people, people who hadnt thought out everything the way we had. We had a plan that started in high school and followed us into parenthood and suburbia. The plan, we knew, wasnt going to be easy, and wed have to work hard at it; but as a team, we could accomplish it and achieve our goals, which would eventually make our lives very comfortable.
So what went wrong? How could this horrendously destructive force of infidelity, enter into our lives and cause such damage? How did I let this happen to us? Whenever I questioned him about anything out of the ordinary, he would just explain how I was a paranoid wife and didnt know what she was talking about. Obviously then, it was my fault that this has happened, but how is it my fault? I had just wanted to be a good wife and mother and had worked so hard to accomplish that by sticking to our plan. But he said it was my fault, so it must be. Right? Had I seen the signs and foolishly ignored them? Apparently so!" />
