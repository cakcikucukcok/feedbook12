  <title>The Mulligan - Ken Blanchard, Wally Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone Needs a Second Chance on the Course and In LifePaul McAllister was a driven man. Ivy League educated and the founder of a multimillion dollar business, Paul was a success in everything but life-and golf. It only took one Pro-Am afternoon, one short putt, and one airborne putter to send his world flying in a different direction: a mulligan! Golf&#39;s gracious do-over, a mulligan is the beginning of Paul&#39;s own second chance. Guided by the wisdom and advice of an Old Pro, Paul learns about priorities, about self-confidence, and about playing a good game both on and off the course. Written in the appealing &quot;parable&quot; style of other best-selling books such as Who Moved My Cheese?, Gungo Ho! , and Whale Done! , golf pro Wally Armstrong and author Ken Blanchard condense decades of practical know-how into a simple book with an amazing message. The Mulligan is a second chance to change it all, and improve both your life and your game!" />
