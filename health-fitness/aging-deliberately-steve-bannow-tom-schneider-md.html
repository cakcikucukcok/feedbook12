      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a world where it is often expected that our later years of life will be a slow march toward inactivity and decreasing vitality, it can be challenging to make a conscious effort to age deliberately. Thankfully, it is possible to embrace the aging process and bring about changes that instigate joy, fulfillment, and fun as we gain years, wisdom, and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Bannow and Tom Schneider, MD, draw upon their professional and personal experiences to share practical advice and illuminating insight that helps the aging population deal intelligently and holistically with virtually every important aspect of life and the aging process. Their guidebook not only includes their philosophies on aging, but also covers a wide range of topics that include innovative recommendations on how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;maintain a positive and healthy attitude;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;navigate through medical and dietary components of the aging process;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remain productive after retirement;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;plan for the future;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop a sense of spirituality; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;become comfortable with end-of-life decisions and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aging Deliberately&lt;/i&gt; shares new and exhilarating ways to stay mentally engaged, physically active, and happy as ever, no matter how many years we add to our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
