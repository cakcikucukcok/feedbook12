  <title>To Love an Enemy - Dovye Ann Culpepper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The beautiful but modest Hannah Thornton leaves Ireland in search of a family to call her own, with only three filled trunks and her faith in God. A scabrous voyage across the North Atlantic brings many adventures, and her life is changed when Nathan, a British seaman, falls in love with her. Hannahs deep respect and loyalty to her father causes Nathan to fear for her to learn his true identity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	Hannahs destination is a plantation near Charleston, South Carolina, at a time when slavery abounds and cotton is king. When Congress of the United States declares war on Great Britain, Hannah and Nathan become caught up in the War of 1812. Before the war is over, a British blockade along the eastern coast of the United States brings near devastation to South Carolina cotton planters.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	At the Reybrook Plantation, Hannah finds her family, but with their love she must also share their burdens and heartaches. While employed as a teacher to the plantation owners children, the owners son, Ben Rey, and she establish a church. Things become complicated when Ben falls in love with her.
	&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Hannah and Nathans love strong enough to overpower the obstacles that come between them and to endure their long separation brought on by the war? And what will happen if Nathan meets Ben on the battlefield? To Love an Enemy is an intriguing love story that is filled with historical facts about the great powers of the world and their rivalry in the trade industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;To Love An Enemy&quot; is one of the best Christian Romances that I have read.  Its contents are clean enough for young people, and the elder.  The characters come alive with excitement that keeps you reading and wondering throughout the pages.  The words flow so the reading is easy.  You will not want to quit reading until the end, and then you will want to start over again.  This Christian romance, mixed with history and mystery, will make you think you are right there sharing in the lives of the characters.  Descriptions of the scenery are so vivid that you actually see them as if you were gazing at them in real life.  You don&#39;t want to miss reading this one.  Hopefully, there will be a sequel to this book.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
