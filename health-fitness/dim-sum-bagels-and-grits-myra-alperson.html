  <title>Dim Sum, Bagels, and Grits - Myra Alperson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An informed, comprehensive guide to raising a multicultural family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times do you celebrate the New Year at home?  Just once?  If your family is Jewish, Chinese, and a few other things besides, you might celebrate twice or even three times a year!  As the rate of cross-cultural adoption grows in the United States, new traditions are emerging.  These are part of a new multiculturalism which, with its attendant joys and challenges, has become a fact of life in urban, suburban and even rural America.  Alperson&#39;s sourcebook offers families the first complete guide to the tangled questions that surround this important phenomenon.  As the adoptive Jewish mother of Sadie, her Chinese-born daughter, Alperson is able to offer personal as well as professional insight into such topics as combining cultures in the home, confronting prejudice, and developing role models.  Focusing on adoptive families - international and transracial adoption in the United States has jumped in recent years - she provides guidelines on how families can prepare for their exciting journey toward becoming a multicultural family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to drawing on extensive interviews with such families, her book includes a wealth of on-line and &quot;conventional&quot; resources to find books, food products, toys, clothing, discussion groups and heritage camps that help families to enhance their lives as they build a multicultural home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
