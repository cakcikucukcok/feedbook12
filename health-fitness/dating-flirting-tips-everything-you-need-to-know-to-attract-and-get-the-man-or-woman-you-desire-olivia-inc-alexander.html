      <meta name="description" content="For both men and women, dating is not easy. There are no tricks and no easy route to take in order to be able to date the person you want. To be successful in dating you have to be aware of what you&amp;#39;re doing, which means that you have to also know what to not do during a date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For men, they are usually expected to take the initiative so it&amp;#39;s a lot harder for them to muster the courage to ask a woman out on a date with them. For women, the issue lies within being able to get a date with a man that they have an interest in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&amp;#39;s why, for your convenience, I&amp;#39;ve included tips for both men and women. The beauty to this is that you can also take a peek at what your partner might be looking for or what they might not like. A better advantage for you to start with." />
