  <title>Measure for Measure -  William Shakespeare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Shakespeare&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dark&amp;quot; comedy &amp;quot;Measure for Measure&amp;quot; was written about 1603&amp;ndash;04 and published in the First Folio of 1623 from a transcript of an authorial draft.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The play doesn&amp;#39;t fit as nicely into the comedy pigeonhole as &amp;quot;A Midsummer Night&amp;#39;s Dream&amp;quot;. After reading &amp;quot;Measure for Measure&amp;quot;, the audience is not left with a happily-ever-after feeling. Though the plot is resolved with marriages-a-plenty, like in most of Shakespeare&amp;#39;s comedies, they are not exactly marriages that have anything to do with love. In fact, several of the characters are basically sentenced to marriage as a punishment. Therefore, most scholars lump &amp;quot;Measure for Measure&amp;quot; as one of Shakespeare&amp;#39;s problem plays, containing a mixture of tragic and comic elements, making them more difficult to classify.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;quot;Measure for Measure&amp;quot;, Vienna is teeming with brothels and loose morality, but the Duke doesn&amp;#39;t want to use his authority to clean up the city. He departs, dressed as a friar, leaving his deputy, Angelo, in charge. Angelo is at first reluctant, but he soon starts to make changes.&lt;br /&gt;
Thinking the Duke absent, Angelo wrongfully imprisons a young nobleman who has impregnated his fianc&amp;eacute;, Juliet. Disguised as a Friar, the Duke manipulates events so that Angelo faces the consequences of his actions." />
