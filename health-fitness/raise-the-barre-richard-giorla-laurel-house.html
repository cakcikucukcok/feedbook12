  <title>Raise the Barre - Richard Giorla, Laurel House</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive guide to the hottest new fitness program in the country-Cardio Barre-a dance-based workout that combines cardio, strength training and stretching, in one fast-paced, fat-burning, body-lengthening session. With a full nutrition program as well, you&#39;ll see life-changing results in only eight weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While yoga, pilates, aerobics and weightlifting are all successful, popular fitness routines, each one of them is missing something that the others offer. And with our hectic lives that leave little time for sleep, let alone hours of daily exercise, the Cardio Barre workout is the perfect combination of cardio, strength training and stretching&amp;#8212;achieving multiple desired results from one fast-paced workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Giorla is a classically trained dancer who has learned from his decades of training that the key to strength and endurance is developing core muscle&amp;#8212;the center of the body must be strong in order to support the other areas of the body. In Cardio Barre, you work from your core&amp;#8212;maintaining your balance using a barre, a countertop, a chair, or even your own strength&amp;#8212;then repeat low-resistance motions such as plies, arm extensions, and leg flexes. With no kicking, jumping, or punching, this effective and complete workout leaves participants with long, lean muscles, flexibility, and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the success of the Cardio Barre workout in LA, where it has gained celebrity adherents and a long waiting list of others, as well as the recent launch of Cardio Barre in New York, this is poised to become the new &quot;it&quot; workout. And unlike past fitness fads, Cardio Barre sets realistic goals, including following a healthy eating program, and offers the desired results of both cardio health and strength in only eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
