  <title>Why Is Brian So Fat? - Gary Solomon, Lynne Adamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Meet Brian. Brian is fat. He&#39;s fat because he eats too much. And he eats too much because that&#39;s how he keeps from feeling his feelings. He has many feelings about his family, his friends, his school, his dog, and himself, but most of those feelings Brian isn&#39;t even aware of having. He just knows something is not right at home or with his mother or his father or his sister, so Brian eats and eats and eats. A teacher, who shares her own struggles with childhood obesity, offers Brian a glimmer of hope and encourages him to talk about his feelings.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Childhood obesity has become an epidemic in the US and has grown significantly in recent years. The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that one out of every three children and adolescent aged two to nineteen years old are obese. Children who are overweight have an 80 percent chance of becoming an obese adult. Childhood obesity is also associated with an increased risk of emotional problems. Many overweight children are ostracized from peer groups and often teased or worse, bullied.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Why Is Brian So Fat?&lt;/I&gt; comes with an activity guide in the back of the book so that parents, children, teachers, and health care providers can examine and discuss those emotional issues related to overeating in an honest and entertaining way, as well as offer an opportunity to look at the reasons someone may become overweight. Healthy eating tips, exercising solutions, and a list of resources are also included.&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
