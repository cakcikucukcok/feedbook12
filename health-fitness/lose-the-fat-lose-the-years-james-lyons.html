  <title>Lose the Fat, Lose the Years - James Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fat is Not the Enemy! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today&#39;s youth-obsessed culture, mixed messages about diet, exercise, and skincare are everywhere. But one thing is clear: fat is always the enemy. Right? Wrong, says James R. Lyons, M.D. In LOSE THE FAT, LOSE THE YEARS, Dr. Lyons explains that, contrary to popular belief, fat is the key to a youthful looking face and body. But it has to be the right kind of fat. With his nearly 30 years of clinical experience, Dr. Lyons had noticed the presence of different types of fat in the body, one that makes us look old, and one that gives our bodies a youthful appearance. LOSE THE FAT, LOSE THE YEARS reveals, for the first time, how retaining &quot;good&quot; fat while losing &quot;bad&quot; fat is the key to a healthier, leaner body &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;more youthful glow. Change your body with a unique and sensible eating and exercise program that includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt;A four-week eating plan that alternates carbohydrates and proteins, keeping blood sugar at an even keel to avoid fat production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*A monthly exercise routine centered on weights and bungee cords--&lt;i&gt;not cardio&lt;/i&gt;--keeping metabolism up continuously (not temporarily, as cardio does) to burn more fat&lt;br&gt;Revolutionary in concept, LOSE THE WEIGHT, LOSE THE YEARS will change the way you think about fat - and the results will last for the rest of your life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
