  <title>36 Hours with an Angel - Lindsay Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In January 1984, I endured a sorrow deeper than my worst nightmares and fears. After experiencing two miscarriages, several surgeries, and an enormous amount of emotional disappointment trying to have children, I saw my newborn son&amp;#39;s life slip away from me after only 36 hours on this earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the sorrow and loss began to surround me, I struggled to survive, as any mother would. It didn&amp;#39;t matter that I was part of a well-known family and married to an evangelist. It didn&amp;#39;t matter that they were known by millions of people across America and the world. The grief still cut me like a knife. Despair still haunted my waking and sleeping hours, and I wondered if I could ever know joy again after losing my precious baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In that desperate time, I turned to God. Although pain and sorrow can invade anyone&amp;#39;s life in any area of life, I believe God is quick to bring comfort and healing to those who call out to Him.&lt;br&gt;" />
