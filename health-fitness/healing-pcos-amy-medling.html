In this welcome guide, Amy Medling shows how to combine an anti-inflammatory and hormone-balancing diet, daily movement, and stress-reducing self-care to successfully treat&amp;#160;their PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in the latest medical research and filled with the knowledge she&amp;#8217;s acquired dealing with PCOS herself and working with thousands of women, &lt;em&gt;Healing PCOS&lt;/em&gt; offers women small, manageable steps that help alleviate their symptoms and control the inflammation, hormonal imbalance, and insulin resistance that underlie the condition. Amy&amp;#8217;s revolutionary program consists of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 21-day anti-inflammatory, hormone-balancing and gluten-free meal plan, including meal prep and plan-ahead tips to make eating this way simple and fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;85 delicious recipes&amp;#8212;half fan favorites and half new dishes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily self-care exercises, including meditation and journaling prompts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy has helped tens of thousands of women with PCOS take back control of their health and their lives through lasting, healing, and sustainable lifestyle change.
