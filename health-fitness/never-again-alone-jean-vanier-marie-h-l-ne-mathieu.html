  <title>Never Again Alone! - Jean Vanier, Marie-Hélène Mathieu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Holy Father gives thanks to God for the beautiful witness of Faith and Light. His Holiness prays that the joy you bring to one another through the friendship that you share may shine brightly for all to see.&lt;br&gt;
For the Holy Father Pope Francis, Angelo Becciu, Substitute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tale of rare human and spiritual density. It is proper to thank these two disciples, Marie-Hlne and Jean, for having written this sort of gospel where we see how much providence watches over those who surrender themselves totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Marie Gunois, Le Figaro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished this superb book, Never Again Alone, which retraces the adventure of Faith and Light. Providence has inspired Marie-Hlne Mathieu and Jean Vanier through all these years and the fruits exceed all expectation.&lt;br&gt;
Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, &lt;br&gt;
inspiration for the film, Intouchables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 1971; persons with intellectual disabilities and their families are still very marginalized in society and in the Church. Jean Vanier and Marie-Hlne Mathieu are going to break open a way for them in launching the Faith and Light pilgrimage to Lourdesan incredible event and the improbable birth of an international movement that has grown in 80 countries with 1,500 communities that meet regularly, bringing together 50,000 members. This is a passionate and often poignant account. It has been translated into Italian, Portuguese, English, Spanish and Polish.&lt;/p&gt;" />
