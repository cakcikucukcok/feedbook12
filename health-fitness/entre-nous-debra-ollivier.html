  <title>Entre Nous - Debra Ollivier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what gives French women that &lt;i&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first you might think it&#39;s the elegant figure, matchless style, and mysterious allure. Then you realize those qualities don&#39;t come from just anywhere. They come from generations of women raised to cultivate an extraordinary sense of self. French women know who they are, like who they are, and excel at presenting who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of us are often susceptible to the next fad, the new thing, the ultimate diet. We&#39;re always seeking, instead of realizing that what we already are may be just right. Rarely does an American woman feel as comfortable in her own skin as her French counterpart. And rarely does an American woman have that essentially French ability to say no---to refuse anything that doesn&#39;t suit her, whether that thing is a job, a man, or the season&#39;s latest styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provocative and practical, lively and intelligent, &lt;i&gt;Entre Nous&lt;/i&gt; unlocks the mystery of the French girl and the secrets of her self-possession. Why do French women always look inimitably stylish? How do they manage to sit in a café for a three-course lunch and a glass of wine...by themselves? How do they decide when they&#39;re ready to let someone become a part of their very private lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laced with practical tips, engaging sidebars, and essential observations about French women and their ways, &lt;i&gt;Entre Nous&lt;/i&gt; is a delightful book that will help you take the best of all pages from the French girl&#39;s book---the page that reveals how to really enjoy life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
