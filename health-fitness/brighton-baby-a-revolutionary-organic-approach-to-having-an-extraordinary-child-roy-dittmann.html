  <title>Brighton Baby: a Revolutionary Organic Approach to Having an Extraordinary Child - Roy Dittmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brighton Baby: A Revolutionary Organic Approach to Having an Extraordinary Child - The Complete Guide to Preconception &amp; Conception is about helping couples achieve optimal health - mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually - before you conceive your future child.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author and perinatal expert, Roy Dittmann, OMD, MH takes couples on a journey that celebrates the power of love as the intangible blueprint of life. Dr. Dittmann exposes the dangers of conceiving in our toxic world and focuses couples on how to prepare body, mind, and spirit for the moment of conception. Using integral wisdom, Dr. Dittmann helps couples go from overwhelm to taking practical steps to realize their goals of having an extraordinary child.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Brighton Baby is about the art and science of gifting the best of who we are to our future children. It is about reducing human suffering by preventing subtle and overt birth defects before they occur. It is about transforming the context inside of which we conceive and birth children. - Roy Dittmann, OMD, MH, author&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the book, Dr. Dittmann turns the spotlight on the hidden dangers of: heavy metals and other toxins, genetically modified foods, pesticides, artificial sweeteners, rancid oils, antibiotics, processed foods, contaminated drinking water, electrosmog, and the pluses &amp; minuses of vaccines - merging science and common sense to compel couples to take action today to prevent birth defects in their future child. Brighton Baby is a call to action for couples to commit now to consciously preparing for your future child together." />
