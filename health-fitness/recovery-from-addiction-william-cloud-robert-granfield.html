  <title>Recovery from Addiction - William Cloud, Robert Granfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Millions of people enter or seriously consider entering alcohol or drug treatment each year. In their understandable state of urgency, most first-time treatment seekers and their loved ones may rush to the first treatment option they encounter. They are unlikely to be aware of why one form of intervention would be a good choice for their particular problem or why some approaches may, under some conditions, actually be harmful. Lacking reliable information, they are unable to make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;ti1&gt;Recovery from Addiction&lt;/ti1&gt; offers a concise, reader-friendly guide for substance dependent persons, their families, and friends to help make sense of the full range of available treatment options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cloud and Granfield introduce readers to their options, from inpatient and outpatient programs and today&#39;s major pharmacological approaches to alternative therapies including strategies for using the Internet to access support meetings and approaches which do not call for life-long abstinence from the substances now causing the problem. They outline the underlying principles of each program, its pros and cons, and what a participant can expect when entering that type of treatment, guiding readers in choosing the approach likely to be best for them or their loved one. They also provide specific strategies for addicted individuals who wish to consider recovery on their own, without groups or treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A vital resource for addicts wishing to recover and their loved ones, &lt;ti1&gt;Recovery from Addiction&lt;/ti1&gt; is also a valuable tool for health care professionals, from social workers to school counselors, responsible for referring clients to drug and alcohol recovery programs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
