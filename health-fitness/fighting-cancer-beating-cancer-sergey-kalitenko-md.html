  <title>Fighting Cancer, Beating Cancer - Sergey Kalitenko Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So when do you think theyll finally figure out how to cure cancer? This simple question posed during dinner one evening sparks a conversation that will change the lives of four lifelong friends forever. 
What starts as a simple discussion about the high cost of cancer and the merits of early detection quickly evolves into a much deeper and more informed dialogue about the benefits of complementary cancer therapies. Sam, a New York City holistic practitioner, has decades of alternative medicine experience to share with his best friend, Mike, and their wives. He can talk knowledgeably about a variety of topics, ranging from how to prevent cancer, boost your immune system naturally, and avoid environmental toxins to what vitamins, nutrients, and hormones can best support cancer management. 
From a functional medicine perspective, Sams position is clear. Complementary cancer treatments are just thatways to complement traditional therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. Because they address the root cause of patients problems, holistic approaches are a whole-body, medically sound way of managing this very insidious and painful disease.
