  <title>How to Live to Be 100—And Like It! - Clifford Bebell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No one is truly qualified to state definitely how to live to be one hundred, although there has been much research on the subject. There are too many uncertainties and unknowns. Looking at the research, though, talking with experts in many fields, and assessing his experiences in a long lifetime have given Clifford Bebell insight into many factors that seem to contribute to longevity. &lt;i&gt;How to Live to Be 100and Like It!&lt;/i&gt; is the culmination of his thoughts on how to happily thrive in retirement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His life has been full of the incidents and accidents of retired life after those of a working life have passed. He acquired and applied many practical ideas learned in his ninety-five years of living, including the experiences of fifty-eight years of marriage and membership in a family of thirty-two, including six children, thirteen grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To anyone whos ever wondered what life would be like after retirement, wonder no more! Its not ceaseless pleasure! Its not endless leisure! Its the rest of your life! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let &lt;i&gt;How to Live to Be 100and Like It!&lt;/i&gt; help you to make choices, face decisions, learn alternatives, and see possibilities to live to be one hundred and be happy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
