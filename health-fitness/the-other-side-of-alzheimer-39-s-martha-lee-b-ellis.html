  <title>The Other Side of Alzheimer&#39;s - Martha-Lee B. Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alzheimers and marriage is a complex combination of emotions. You change, too, when your spouse has Alzheimers. This is a poignant collection of personal experiences, moving from confusion, loneliness, and fear to understanding and peace. Knowledge of resources and connecting with others who are, or have been, faced with this consuming task help you find your way through the maze of many unanticipated challenges. Finding the support of others is critical to achieving acceptance of this life-changing event. With a sprinkling of humor, this becomes a story of the power of love, allowing you to survive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Other Side of Alzheimers is written with honesty, sensitivity, and love. Every experience describes the physical, mental, and emotional challenges, while alluding to humor and hope. There are few published resources that deal with feelings of a spouse faced with a partners Alzheimers disease, and none I have read as good as this one. I found it to be a beautiful love story that any reader can appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ellis has written a beautiful, insightful account of the journey through Alzheimers. It reveals how love, understanding and the acceptance of change can overcome any adversity. It applies to us all as we navigate through the ebb and flow of a significant relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Martha-Lee Ellis has written a touching memoir that approaches Alzheimers from a wifes perspective of a scary and unpredictable course. The Other Side of Alzheimers offers a lifeline to others going through this experience, enabling them to see that they are not alone. This story has something to benefit anyone facing this disease with their spouse. &lt;/p&gt;
