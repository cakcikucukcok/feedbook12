  <title>The Manual that Never Came with your Child - Jane Jarvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parents and caregivers struggle to cope with the demands of modern day living and need practical ways to help them raise happy, well-adjusted and independent children. This book includes invaluable and practical advice on how to improve a child&#39;s planning and organisational skills, how to tackle homework, and general discipline. The Manual That Never Came With Your Child shows parents/caregivers: how to create an appropriate environment for the child to do his or her homework; the setting up of routines; how to organise weekly and monthly planners; how to teach a child to study; how to devise the ultimate homework diary; ideas on games and activities to improve a child&#39;s visual and auditory perceptual skills, their reading, spelling and times tables as well as fine and gross motor skills; what children need to eat to optimise brain power. The sticky issue of discipline is also covered comprehensively. Written in easy laymen&#39;s terms, the often-humorous text is accompanied by full-colour cartoon illustrations throughout, which &#39;lightens&#39; the approach to issues that are often regarded as nightmares by despairing parents. Where necessary, there are also colour photographs. Regular &#39;Handy Hints&#39; boxes are included to summarise the preceding concepts in a nutshell." />
