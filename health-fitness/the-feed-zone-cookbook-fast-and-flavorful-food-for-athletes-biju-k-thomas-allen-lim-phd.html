  <title>The Feed Zone Cookbook: Fast and Flavorful Food for Athletes - Biju K. Thomas, Allen Lim, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Feed Zone Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; offers 150 athlete-friendly recipes that are simple, delicious, and easy to prepare.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Allen Lim left the lab to work with pro cyclists, he found a peloton weary of food. For years the sport&#39;s elite athletes had been underperforming on bland fare and processed bars and gels. Science held few easy answers for nutrition in the real world, where hungry athletes must buy ingredients; make meals; and enjoy eating before, during, and after each workout, day after day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Lim set out to make eating delicious and practical. His journey began with his mom, took him inside the kitchens of the Tour de France, and delivered him to a dinner party where he met celebrated chef Biju Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chef Biju and Dr. Lim vetted countless meals with the world&#39;s best endurance athletes during the world&#39;s most demanding races. &lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Feed Zone Cookbook: Fast and Flavorful Food for Athletes&lt;/i&gt;, Thomas and Lim share their energy-packed, nutritious recipes to make meals easy to prepare, delicious to eat, and better for performance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Feed Zone Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; provides 150 delicious recipes that even the busiest athletes can prepare in less time than it takes to warm up for a workout. Allen and Lim offer breakfasts and pre-workout meals from oatmeal to egg dishes, portable foods that taste great during exercise including rice cakes and muffins, after-workout recovery meals and snacks that recharge your muscles quickly, dessert drinks and treats, simple sauces and dressings, and delicious dinners including chef Biju&#39;s favorite pastas, soups and salads, empanadas, pizzas and burgers, seafood, Indian cuisine, grilled dishes, poultry, pork, and beef. With simple recipes requiring just a handful of ingredients, Biju and Allen show how easy it is for athletes to prepare their own food, whether at home or on the go. You will love how many recipes from &lt;i&gt;The Feed Zone Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; make it into your regular rotation of favorite meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Feed Zone Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; includes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 150 delicious recipes illustrated with full-color photographs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Breakfasts, lunches, recovery meals, dinners, snacks, desserts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Portable real food snacks, including Lim&#39;s famous rice cakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Dr. Allen Lim&#39;s approach to the practice of food for athletes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Dozens of quick-prep meals for before and after workouts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Shortcuts, substitutions, and techniques to save time in the kitchen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Over 100 gluten-free and vegetarian alternatives to favorite dishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Feed Zone Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; offers a simple, fresh way for athletes to enjoy cooking and dramatically improve their workout nutrition.&lt;/b&gt; Lim and Thomas strike the perfect balance between the science of nutrition and the practice of eating. You&#39;ll taste the difference. You&#39;ll feel the difference. And you may begin thinking differently how food can make sports better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For even more portable recipes from the Feed Zone, don&#39;t miss &lt;i&gt;Feed Zone Portables&lt;/i&gt;.
