  <title>The Happiness Curve - Jonathan Rauch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;In this warm, wise, and witty overview, Jonathan Rauch combines evidence and experience to show his fellow adults that the best is yet to come.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Steven Pinker, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;This book will change your life by showing you how life changes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does happiness get harder in your 40s? Why do you feel in a slump when you&#39;re successful? Where does this malaise come from? And, most importantly, will it ever end?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on cutting-edge research, award-winning journalist Jonathan Rauch answers all these questions. He shows that from our 20s into our 40s, happiness follows a U-shaped trajectory, a &quot;happiness curve,&quot; declining from the optimism of youth into what&#39;s often a long, low slump in middle age, before starting to rise again in our 50s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This isn&#39;t a midlife &lt;i&gt;crisis&lt;/i&gt;, though. Rauch reveals that this slump is instead a natural stage of life--and an essential one. By shifting priorities away from competition and toward compassion, it equips you with new tools for wisdom and gratitude to win the third period of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Rauch can testify to this personally because it was his own slump, despite acclaim as a journalist and commentator that compelled him to investigate the happiness curve. His own story and the stories of many others from all walks of life--from a steelworker and a limo driver to a telecoms executive and a philanthropist--show how the ordeal of midlife malaise reboots our values and even our brains for a rebirth of gratitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of insights and data and featuring many ways to endure the slump and avoid its perils and traps, &lt;i&gt;The Happiness Curve &lt;/i&gt;doesn&#39;t just show you the dark forest of midlife, it helps you find a path through the trees. It also demonstrates how we can--and why we must--do more to help each other through the woods. Midlife is a journey we mustn&#39;t walk alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
