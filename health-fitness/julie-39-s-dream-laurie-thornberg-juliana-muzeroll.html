  <title>Julie&#39;s Dream - Laurie Thornberg, Juliana Muzeroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR:
One day my friend Juli left a handmade card on my kitchen counter. In the card, Juli described a dream she had about my being healed of cancer. Out of this beautiful gesture came the idea for &quot;Julie&#39;s Dream.&quot; I wanted to create a book for parents, grandparents, other relatives and friends, to share the news, treatment plan, and encouragement with children when someone they love is diagnosed with cancer. In the story, Julie finds out that she has cancer. As she goes through treatment and starts to feel better, she has a magic dream of becoming well again. Treatment for cancer is more successful than ever before. Many cancer victims become cancer survivors. Finding out that someone you love has cancer is just the beginning. What follows is a journey. Treatment, support, prayer, coping, hope, healing. There is a beauty that can be found in all the love that comes out of having a struggle with cancer. Thank you to all the people who supported me through my breast cancer journey and made my recovery beautiful.
