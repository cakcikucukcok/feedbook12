  <title>Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy - Rudy Dragone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All through our lives we are plagued with certain truths, we are born, we live and we die. Many of us live life never really having great health. 
Everywhere you turn these days you hear and see more and more news and advertising about Hormone Replacement Therapies (HRTs).  From large pharmaceuticals marketing the latest synthetic low testosterone replacement roll-on to celebrities extolling the virtues of Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy, (BHRT) as a virtual fountain of youth.
The truth is there are a lot of mistruths about the role bioidentical hormones can have in the cure of several sever symptoms; the overall wellbeing of your patients and safety concerns about their use.
This book is to serve as a guide to understanding the role hormones have in assessing symptoms that may be aggravated by hormonal imbalances or deficiencies.  The last half of this book contains a clinical reference guide to help healthcare practitioners check for hormonal imbalances and recommend dosing of bioidentical hormones in the treatment of their patients.
The goals of this book are to:
1.	Educate healthcare professionals about the role of hormones in the wellness of their patients.
2.	Educate the public of the significant role hormonal imbalances can play in their overall wellness.
3.	Provide the necessary tools to determine if bioidentical hormone replacement therapies are appropriate for your patients.
4.	Help expand healthcare practices through referrals by happy, healthy patients and bioidentical hormone replacement therapies that improve patient lives while making sound business sense to your practice.
The roll that bioidentical hormone replacement therapy has in overall wellbeing for millions of people is simply remarkable." />
