  <title>The Happiness Track - Emma Seppala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants happiness and success, yet the pursuit of both has never been more elusive. As work and personal demands rise, we try to keep up by juggling everything better, moving faster, and doing more. While we might succeed in the short term, this approach comes at a high cost in the long term: it hurts our well-being, our relationships, and&amp;#8212;paradoxically&amp;#8212;our productivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this life-changing book, Emma Sepp&amp;#228;l&amp;#228; explains that the reason we are burning ourselves out is that we fall for outdated theories of success. We are taught that getting ahead means doing everything that&amp;#8217;s thrown at us with razor-sharp focus and iron discipline, that success depends on our drive and talents, and that achievement cannot happen without stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happiness Track&lt;/em&gt; demolishes these counterproductive theories. Drawing on the latest scientific research on happiness, resilience, willpower, compassion, positive stress, creativity, and mindfulness, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sepp&amp;#228;l&amp;#228; demonstrates that being happy is the most productive thing we can do to thrive&amp;#8212;whether at work or at home. She shares practical strategies for applying these scientific findings to our daily lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fulfilling, successful, and anxiety-free life is within your reach. &lt;em&gt;The Happiness Track&lt;/em&gt; will show you the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happiness Is the Fast Track to Success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Are you a hard-driving, multitasking, conscientiously striving professional? Then your ideas about success are probably all wrong&amp;#8212;and you need &lt;em&gt;The Happiness Track&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Emma Sepp&amp;#228;l&amp;#228;&amp;#8217;s investigation into the counter-intuitive factors that create career and life success. The best news of all? All these skills are well within your grasp.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Daniel H. Pink, author of &lt;em&gt;Drive&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Whole New Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Emma Sepp&amp;#228;l&amp;#228; convinces us that reconfiguring our brain for happiness can change the way our lives unfold and the way we approach success. A worthwhile read for anyone who wants to achieve a successful and fulfilling life.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Amy Cuddy, professor at Harvard Business School and author of &lt;em&gt;Presence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Backed by extensive research in psychology and neuroscience, The Happiness Track offers a wealth of insight on changing how we approach our work, our personal lives, and our relationships. It&amp;#8217;s a carefully researched, engaging look at how to improve ourselves without losing our authenticity or our sanity.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Adam Grant, Wharton professor and New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Give and Take and Originals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Through her research-backed strategies, Emma Sepp&amp;#228;l&amp;#228; teaches us not only how to thrive in our chosen profession, but how to stay true to ourselves&amp;#8212;and enjoy every moment of the process.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Susan Cain, cofounder of &lt;em&gt;Quiet Revolution&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Quiet &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For decades we&amp;#8217;ve been tied to theories of success that have burned us out and driven us into the ground&amp;#8212;because we don&amp;#8217;t know of any alternatives. The Happiness Track provides us with a highly readable, science-backed solution to obtaining sustainable success, the sort of success we are all really striving for, that leaves us fulfilled, happy, and healthy.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Scott Barry Kaufman, Ph.D., scientific director at the Imagination Institute at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;" />
