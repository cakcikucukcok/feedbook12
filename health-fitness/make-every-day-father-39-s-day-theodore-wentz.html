  <title>Make Every Day Father&#39;s Day - Theodore Wentz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This was to be a book about a woman who literally gave her life to her children by helping to raise a number of her own siblings after the deaths of her parents by age sixteen. She then went on to raise all of her children by herself, but since her death in March of 2003, Ive decided to write about the benefits of raising three of her grandchildren to complete her legacy. This is a book to help young adults understand that they can achieve their personal goals, be it educationally, personally, and as parents if they attempt to do it right and with good intentions. This book is to remind young adults that having children is a grown up responsibility that is not to be taken lightly. This book also helps young ladies to love and respect themselves, and to not allow themselves to be taken advantage of. It shows young women that you could grow up, get a good education, learn from your mother and father, and marry a mate who loves you and is willing to be there for you. To be responsible parents who are everyday people, it takes commitment, determination, and not to be afraid to listen to those who could help you. Its hard for young adults to listen to those who could help, but as young people, it can only help you make your life better down the road. Im sure that most young mothers, who decide to give their children up for adoption, wouldnt if they had their childrens responsibility.  As a young man, I wanted to give to my wife and children the things I didnt get and that my mother and the thing that my mother received, while she was growing up. All young adults have to do is believe in themselves, and I believe this book can help them do that." />
