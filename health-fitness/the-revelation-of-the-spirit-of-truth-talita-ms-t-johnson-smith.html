  <title>The Revelation of the Spirit of Truth - Talita (Ms.T) Johnson Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This little Christian faith book called, &quot;The Revelation of the Spirit of Truth&quot;(TROTSOT) is a self-help tool to be used in conjunction with your Bible. It explains in detail the hidden mysteries of God with Scripture and gives you insight into the identity of the beloved disciple, Lucifer, Satan, and the Holy Spirit. This book puts to an end, unanswered questions and Swiss cheese theologies on the&quot; end times.&quot; Spoken from the mouth of one of God&#39;s true watchmen, this book also offers personal experiences and lessons learned to help those who may be struggling to release themselves from the bondage of pornography and masturbation. This book sets the standard of holy living without the chains of religion, offering insight and hidden manna.
     The revelation of the spirit of truth also gives you the formula for decoding the world&#39;s most complex book the Bible.  TROTSOT is not your typical &quot;church book&quot;, it&#39;s a kingdom book, meaning it teaches and focuses on the workings of the spiritual realm and government . It also teaches you how to utilize your heavenly hosts to spice up your marital sex life and take it to a whole other dimension. This book tells of the jealousy of the Guardian of your souls, and of his faithfulness. From the unscripted and unlearned to the doctors of the field, there is something to learn for all.
     While breaking down spiritual giants such as hypocrisy , tithe hustling, spiritual prostitution, as well as the apostate church TROTSOT is nothing of the ordinary . The straight forwardness of this bookmay be considered an insult to the faint of heart and thin skinned. This work bridges the gap between Christianity, Hinduism, and Judaism. From Ezekiel&#39;s wheels, to sefirots ,to chakras TROTSOT gives an introduction to the Spirit Of Wisdom of the ages and the annoiting of the Father. This book reveals the mysteries of God." />
