  <title>Don’T Panic - Jayesh Mody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dont panic draws attention of succumbing youngsters and why they must refrain from committing heinous acts. They not only push their targeted victims into lifelong woes and miseries, but invariably push their mothers too for which they never think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women need to judge for themselves as rescuers and evaluate their commitments in order to channelize the power to protect not only their own children but also for those who are unfortunate for any reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont panic also draws a hypothesis that the Special Children arrive in this world not as sufferers but as observers - We must perform our best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont panic appeals to develop devices for transmitting compassion, especially for those region(s) where the people suffer with sudden devastate Mother Nature and where the innocent are being killed and tortured by the tyrants and persecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our deeds, decisions and thoughts create boomerang effects in our lives with certainty in many astonishing ways which ultimately makes our destiny. We can always choose to be happy. &lt;/p&gt;" />
