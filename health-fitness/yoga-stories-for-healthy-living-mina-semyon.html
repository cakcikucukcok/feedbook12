  <title>Yoga Stories for Healthy Living - Mina Semyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Open this book at any page, be inspired by its wisdom, and laugh out loud at its humor and common sense. Through the practice of yoga and mindfulness, you begin to tune into your body and identify and let go of unnecessary holding on. You discover inside the tense, unbalanced body a sensible body, which can be effortlessly at ease with energy flowing freely and the mind becoming calm. Each posture is a prayer, an intention to open to the law of the universe and let go of your conditioning. They say it runs in the family; it only runs because we let it. 
Yoga is not only on the mat; its also what you do going about your ordinary daily life. Whether youre in the office, on a crowded bus, or in your car stuck in a traffic jam, you can connect to your breath.
Its never too late or too early to start and continue aligning mind, body, and spirit. We find it hard to keep going with a practice thats beneficial to us. May we encourage each other, wishing all of us who are confused, feel not good enough, or are not able to stick to our good intentions, to give it a go and never give up." />
