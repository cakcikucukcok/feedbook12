  <title>The New Game of Men - Lisa Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lacie has wasted half her life on men...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lacie first meets Ike, she is fresh out of high school, naive, and insanely attracted to this older man who inexplicably seems to want her. He, on the other hand, has already married, purchased his first home, started a family, and then left that life far behind. But it doesn&amp;#39;t matter, because Lacie is in love, and Ike offers her a chance at lasting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But when their relationships suddenly dissolves, Lacie finds herself single and desperately throws herself into the hunt for a new man. In the process, she stumbled across Alfie, who is her age and a businessman. He&amp;#39;s perfect in every way, and can give her everything she wants: a doting man, a successful business, and the promise of a bright future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Alfie starts disappearing on late-night rendezvous with a mysterious woman, Lacie starts to question everything she thought was true. Now Alfie loves Mallory-or, at least, he loves her money-and he has the engagement ring to prove it. Except he also has a ring for Lacie because, despite everything, he still wants a future with her...as long as she&amp;#39;s willing to play by his rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Heartbroken and reeling, Lacie must come to terms with the end of her toxic relationship and learn to love herself. Because now she knows she should never settle for anything less than true, devoted, selfless love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The New Game of Men: 21st Century&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a novel that will empower all women and show readers that you don&amp;#39;t need a man or a relationship to be fulfilled and happy. All you need is self-confidence and the drive to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
