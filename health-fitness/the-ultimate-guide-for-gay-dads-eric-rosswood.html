  <title>The Ultimate Guide for Gay Dads - Eric Rosswood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;#1 Amazon New Release!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;If you are thinking of becoming a gay dad ? or if you are already a gay dad ? this book is for you!&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Are you ready to have kids?&lt;/b&gt; More and more gay men are turning to adoption and surrogacy to start their own families. An estimated two million American LBGTQ people would like to adopt and an estimated 65,000 adopted children are living with a gay parent. In 2016, The Chicago Tribune reported that 10 to 20 percent of donor eggs went to gay men expanding their families via surrogacy, and in many places the numbers were up 50 percent from the previous five years.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Gay parenting:&lt;/b&gt; Having a kid is like coming out all over again, on a daily basis, especial if you have an infant. Was coming out stressful for you? It’s about to get more intense and you will have a child watching your every move and listening to your every word. If you stutter or pause, they may pick up on your discomfort and could start to feel like something is wrong about their family unit. &lt;i&gt;The Ultimate Guide For Gay Dads&lt;/i&gt; is jam packed with parenting tips and advice to help you build confidence and become the awesome gay dad you were meant to be! 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How Is This Parenting Guide Different From Others?&lt;/b&gt; Unlike other parenting books that have whole chapters focusing on things specifically related to mothers (such as how to get the perfect latch when breastfeeding), this parenting book replaces those sections with things relevant to gay dads. It covers topics like how to find LGBT friendly pediatricians, how to find LGBT friendly schools, how to childproof your home with style, how to answer awkward and prying questions about your family from strangers, examples for what two-dad families can do on Mother’s Day, and much more. The book also includes parenting tips and advice from pediatricians, school educators, lawyers, and other same-sex parents. 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Top LGBT parenting expert:&lt;/b&gt; Bestselling author Eric Rosswood covers every aspect of fatherhood for gay men in this essential guide to growing your family in the post-DOMA era. He is a major influencer on social media with over 100,000 followers on Twitter alone, as well as thousands on other platforms.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Exploring LGBTQ issues:&lt;/b&gt; Rosswood is an in-demand authority and commentator on LGBTQ issues, including civil rights, parenting, marriage and politics. The author has been featured in major media including The Washington Post, Cosmopolitan, CBS News, The Huffington Post, Elite Daily, Yahoo! News, AOL News, NY Daily News, IB Times, and regional LGBTQ press." />
