  <title>David Lee - Kimberlie K. Hunt-Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Lee The blood of &quot;my will&quot;  is an adventure packed, and inspirational book about family and relationships.  David Lee takes a look into what most teenagers grow up subjected to in today&#39;s peer pressures.  David Lee uniquely shows how people of faith still fall into the tragedy&#39;s and mishaps of today&#39;s world. Three best friends struggle to make a connection between the God their parents praise and the God they can&#39;t see. A father who ignores his son only to hide behind his love of God, a mother left to raise her children alone due to a murderous husband, and a man of God who cant decide if he can be committed to only having one woman in his life while his wife drifts into depression. Three families, and three teenage best friends, who are left to wonder the streets of the big city hungry for adventure and starving for attention.  Adultery, sibling rivalry, and drugs and alcohol all make up the chemistry of David Lee The blood of &quot;my will&quot;. Deception and murder leads to a point where one must choose to turn their faith to God, or fall further into the cycle of vengeance, death, and hate." />
