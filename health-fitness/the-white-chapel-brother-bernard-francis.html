  <title>The White Chapel - Brother “BERNARD Francis&quot;</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book resulted from the requests of family
care givers for a talk about death and dying. They were losing a loved and wanted to know what
to expect.
As nurse practitioner I gained insights from Oncology Nurses, Hospice Nurses and Critical
Care Nurses on how to help terminal patients obtain the most out oftheir remaining time. I went
from a fear oftalking with those dying, to feeling blessed to share this intimate time with them.
After 41 years ofnursing, research and lecturing on this subject I began to understand, as I
applied my own suffering from a disabling illness, ofthe comfort available from the Communion
of Saints. Especially from those who said yes to God&#39;s request they suffer and join this suffering
to that ofHis Son to help other souls, out oflove for Him. Through my experiences with loved
ones, patients and myself, I found tremendous help in turning to the Bible and the writings of
Saints.
This book is a blending of spiritual hope &amp; frank facts regarding suffering &amp; dying that it is
my prayer will bring strength to patents &amp; care givers, be they physicians, nurses, aides or
family." />
