      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the book, My Father&amp;rsquo;s Eyes: A Story of Stolen Lives, author Linda Blackmer asks readers to join her on a journey of personal discovery. &amp;nbsp;Who does she belong to? &amp;nbsp;What is the truth? &amp;nbsp;Who is there to care for an orphaned child?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackmer&amp;rsquo;s journey begins, surprisingly where it ends--with the death of her &amp;ldquo;daddy&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;Returning to Oregon and preparing his house for sale she would find a treasure trove of secrets. &amp;nbsp;The secrets would lead her to finding the truth. &amp;nbsp;A conspiracy of lies keeping an orphaned child from her own family, her own tribe, the keepers of her DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds, the author chronicles for the reader what it is like to live with the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress, as a survivor of childhood abandonment, neglect and abuse. &amp;nbsp;Determined to heal, Blackmer goes back in time to piece together the story of how she came into existence. Bringing together the historical connections--or lack thereof--of family members, she utilizes her skills and knowledge as a clinical social worker to tell the story of multigenerational trauma, so it can have a beginning, middle and end. &amp;nbsp;With compassion and insight, readers will be encouraged to research their own family trees. &amp;nbsp;Leading them to understanding, forgiveness and courage to be their authentic selves. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reader will find the writing understandable and accessible. &amp;nbsp;This book is dedicated to those with Post-Traumatic Stress and to those who love them. &amp;nbsp;The goal and intention are to bring into awareness what it is like to live with the after effects of experiences that are less than normal. &amp;nbsp;Blackmer welcomes those to join her as they too walk their &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rsquo;s journey&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;To know they are not alone, are worthy, and have a friend to walk with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
