      <meta name="description" content="My name is Epoh, and I have a new home! My old home is very far from here. My family and I had to leave. We finally found a place to call home in America. I now live in a big city named New York. This is the story of how New York became my new home. 
My old home and my new home are very different. My old home had big mountains with lots of animals. When I was younger, we had a lake, many trees, and flowers. As I got older, my old home started to change. We were not able to drink from the lake anymore because the water became polluted with toxic chemicals. The trees were cut, and the animals began to disappear." />
