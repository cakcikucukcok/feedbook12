  <title>The Instruction Manual for Kids – Parent’S Edition - Kerri Yarsley, Peter McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whenever a new baby is born, someone usually says, Good luck with your kid, because he doesnt come with an instruction manual! Well, Kerri Yarsley, a successful mother of four, is about to change all that. The Instruction Manual for Kids  Parents Edition is an eminently readable, informative, and entertaining book that takes the reader on a journey from pre-pregnancy preparation all the way through to the late teenage years. It covers the basics as well as some interesting behavioral perspectives that you might not expect in a parenting book. So whether you have one or many kids, be prepared to change your thoughts, words, and actions, and have a brilliant and joyful life with your amazing kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive book sets out many rules of engagement between children and their environment during the formative years from birth to early adulthood. Written specifically for parents  both new and seasoned  the book contains information that makes practical sense on all levels. If you are a resident of Planet Earth, then I highly recommend Kerris book to you. It will inform, amuse, inspire, and move you.&lt;/p&gt;
