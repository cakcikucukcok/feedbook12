  <title>Does This Book Make My Butt Look Big? - Carson Kressley, Riann Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A hilarious style guide for women from fashion guru Carson Kressley, the Emmy-winning TV star and &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carson Kressley has spent the last decade transforming thousands of women and connecting with millions more on &lt;i&gt;Oprah Winfrey, Good Morning America&lt;/i&gt;, and countless other national broadcasts. He knows what makes women tick. Whether we live in Tacoma or Tallahassee, there is a common thread among all of us: we want to feel beautiful but don&#39;t always know where to start. We&#39;re frequently frustrated by fashion and can&#39;t figure out which trends to follow and which to flee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does This Book Make My Butt Look Big?&lt;/i&gt; is a roadmap for all of us to build unshakable body and fashion confidence. Nowhere else is there a fun and accessible book created for the underserved masses like us, who just want to get out the door looking and feeling fabulous. Who don&#39;t have gobs of money to drop on our wardrobe and feel left out of the game.  And when it comes to how we feel about our bodies, all we see are roadblocks...and signs for Burger King!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to be reminded that fashion is FUN. We need to know that with the right tools, we have the power to transform our self-perception by shifting our mindset from woe-is-me to wow-is-me. We need the secrets of playing to our strengths and minimizing our flaws. We need to take more chances, and leave what doesn&#39;t work in the dust. Most of all, we need Carson, our peppy, blond fairy god-stylist, to show us the way!&lt;/p&gt;" />
