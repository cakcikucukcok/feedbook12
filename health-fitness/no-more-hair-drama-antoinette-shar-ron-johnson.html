  <title>No More Hair Drama - Antoinette Shar’ron Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No More Hair Drama is a non-fiction book that chronicles the journey that an African American woman has taken in the world of hair through the many different styles, processes, times, and attitudes toward African American women and their hair.  It is designed to be a learning tool showing the many challenges and pressures that have been put on African American women regarding hair.  This book is a true testament of the African American womans journey into the pursuit of the perfect and ideal style and how that, at times, ties into a womans self-esteem.  The chapters in the book take the readers on a walk through the past, present, and future of hair. More specifically, the book provides details on historical figures such as Madame C.J. Walker and the Bronner Brothers, hair care through the decades, spiritual, health, and cultural aspects of hair, the perspectives of men and women, and the relationship with corporate structures. 
After I locked my hair on December 26, 2001, my mission was to tell a story about my plight in finding myself through my hair, being comfortable in my skin, loving my distinct African features, and truly loving who God made me to be.  It is my estimation that women of African descent continually connect hair with self-esteem and self-worth to the degree that we look at extremes  if our hair is nappy or kinky then it is bad and if our hair is straight or loosely curled then it is good.  
No More Hair Drama is designed to be uplifting, inspiring, empowering, and a conversation piece for African American women and women in general." />
