  <title>How to Build a Stimulating and Everlasting Love in Relationships - Felix O. Jeremiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marriage is an honorable and sacred covenant relationship in which every individual should want to be. Gods foundation for marriage is intended to be a permanent union. In this present world, permanency is overruled by constant changes in law, morals, fashion, and particularly hearts and minds. Individuals who want only to be married become only individuals who want to be on their own or with someone else. Marriages intended to be built on the foundation of love become marriages of trial-by-error tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has gone wrong? Why has a relationship intended by God to be good been made evil? What has brought an end to the love and the joyful life between men and women? The problem is you and me; we have forgotten our divine origin and debased our behaviors to the level of animals or lower. We no longer follow divine will and laws. We have, with our own hands, put a knife into the cord that binds human beings together in love; as a result, the fabric of moral decency and spiritual inclination has fallen apart. Men and women must rediscover their individual relationship with God and Gods role in their relationship with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-discover that your marriage and love relationship is intended to be the most precious and enjoyable union to ever exist on earth. Obedience, submission, and open communication shine brightly in a union founded on real love. This book will open your eyes to the splendor and beauty of marriage by teaching how to build a strong foundation, and how to restore love and confidence in that relationship. Discover real treasure in the advice to be found in How to Build a Stimulating and Everlasting Love in Relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
