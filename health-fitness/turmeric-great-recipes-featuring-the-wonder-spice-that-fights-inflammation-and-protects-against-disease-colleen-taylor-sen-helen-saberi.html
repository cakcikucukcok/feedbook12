  <title>Turmeric: Great Recipes Featuring the Wonder Spice that Fights Inflammation and Protects Against Disease - Colleen Taylor Sen, Helen Saberi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Containing over 70 international recipes, &lt;I&gt;Turmeric&lt;/I&gt; is a cookbook dedicated to one of the most versatile and ancient spices. Originally grown in India and southeast Asia, turmeric is often called a &quot;wonder spice&quot; because of its remarkable curative properties and health applications. But it is the unique, peppery, and earthy taste that has made it so popular across the globe. All of the rich history, recipes, and medical properties of this wonder spice have finally been collected in a single cookbook and resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In recent decades, medical researchers began noticing a lower rate of certain diseases in countries whose inhabitants regularly consume turmeric-rich dishes. Studies have found evidence for turmeric&#39;s therapeutic advantages as related to preventing or treating Alzheimer&#39;s, arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, digestive problems, liver disease, stroke, and infections. Turmeric has many anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which might well be why it has long been used as a panacea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Readers will find a dazzling array of exotic yet straightforward recipes in &lt;I&gt;Turmeric&lt;/I&gt; for soups, snacks, meats, seafood, vegetables, and even pickles and chutneys. These delicious and nutritious dishes will quickly add wonderful flavor to any meal while also promoting lifelong healthy habits.&lt;/div&gt;" />
