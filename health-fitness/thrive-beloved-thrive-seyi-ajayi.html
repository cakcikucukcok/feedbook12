  <title>Thrive . . . Beloved, Thrive!!! - Seyi Ajayi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you hold your baby for the first time, a bond forms; you look out for that child with all your heart. Anyone or anything that touches that child definitely has you to deal with. You are your childs first line of defense. You would protect that child with your life if it came to that; its just a natural instinct. 
Day by day, you pray, Lord help my child to do well, help my child to advance, take my child higher. God hears and answers prayers. Your child is going higher...it s time to leave for college. What? So soon? Where did all the time go? Like it or not, its time for your child to move on. The hold on to the apron strings is gently, slowly but definitely being nipped at. 
But a mothers heart remains the same. You love your baby with all you have and you just want to make sure your child is always armed and prepared for all of lifes balls and curves. Thrive, Beloved, Thrive is a mothers love letter to her child as he leaves for college. 
Filled with words of encouragement, anecdotal stories and Biblical lessons, this book is not only an easy read that every one, particularly, Christian youths embarking on a new venture should read, but if followed closely, it is a guide book for developing critical and essential lifelong skills." />
