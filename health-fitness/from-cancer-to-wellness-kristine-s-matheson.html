  <title>From Cancer to Wellness - Kristine S. Matheson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ultimate guide to surviving cancer, this handbook is packed with information about diet, supplements, attitudes, the best personal-care products to use, and why. This book has done the hard work for you. It is positive and holistic, and explains the importance of nurturing the whole body, mind, and soul back into wellness. Contains: a step-by-step twenty-eight-day simple self-help nutritional program, over fifty tasty, easy recipes, and important lifestyle guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristine Matheson is one of the most positive and courageous women I have ever known. Diagnosed with a stage-four terminal melanoma in 2005, she refused conventional therapy. She gathered all the information available on natural health and nutrition and then designed her own path to wellness. Her victory has become an inspiration to thousands of cancer sufferers around the world through her enthusiastic public seminars and her motivating book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people, when faced with a crisis similar to Kristine&#39;s 2005 death sentence give up, break down, or retreat into themselves. Kristine did none of these. She courageously challenged herself to learn more about health and then share her knowledge with the world. She has helped many discouraged victims move forward and take control of their own health, then triumph without the use of drugs or radiation. Her book contains a wealth of information which details her experiences and research during her personal journey to health. Gary Martin, ND&lt;/p&gt;" />
