  <title>Conversations at Sunset - Fran Hathaway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Catherine and Richard are nearing the end of their lives. An intelligent, introspective couple, they want to die with dignity and without the pain that often accompanies dying. They are also realistic, unafraid to look death in the eye and try to deal with it on their terms. They have lived long and are ailing, and for people like them, as life spans lengthen, end-of-life questions have become more urgent. Those who guide patients and families through lifes final stage call for wiser discussion, better services and a clearer ethical framework. Catherine and Richard, as a final gift to their children, have decided to create an ethical will, a document that spells out the values and principles that have guided them throughout their lives. We listen in as they discuss these very personal guideposts in a conversation full of insight, wisdom, and sometimes humor, but always love." />
