They became each other&#39;s refuge, a safe and magical place far from their troubled lives. Until the day Callen kissed her -- Jessica&#39;s first real, dreamy kiss -- and then disappeared from her life without a word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Years later, everyone knows who Callen Hayes is. Famous composer. Infamous bad boy. What no one knows is that Callen&#39;s music is now locked deep inside, trapped behind his own inner demons. It&#39;s only when he withdraws to France to drink his way through the darkness that Callen stumbles into the one person who makes the music return. Jessica. &lt;i&gt;His Jessie&lt;/i&gt;.
