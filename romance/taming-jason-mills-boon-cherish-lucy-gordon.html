  <title>Taming Jason (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Lucy Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Elinor knew it would be difficult to stay calm and professional while nursing Jason Tenby back to health; he was used to calling the shots. Also, she couldn&#39;t forget the time years ago when Jason had kissed her passionately…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d never forgiven Jason for the trouble it had caused. But now he was injured and temporarily blind. For his sake she must keep her identity a secret. However, as she healed him, she tamed him–and fell for him. All too soon he would be able to see her again– surely he&#39;d recognize her as the woman whom he&#39;d once considered unsuitable marriage material?&lt;/p&gt;
