  <title>Her Hot Number - Talia Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One bad boy billionaire plus one sexy geek equals one hot fling...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a travel nightmare for mathematician Caylee Reynolds. It&#39;s bad enough that her luggage was lost en route to her conference, but when she arrives at the Australian resort and learns that she&#39;s also lost her reservation, Caylee&#39;s ready to break down. Then things get even worse. The resort is owned by Blake Sampson?the bad boy who once took everything from her... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blake thought he&#39;d left his troubled past far behind him. Then the sexy-but-proper math guru he&#39;s never been able to forget walks into his lobby. Hoping to show Caylee he&#39;s changed, he offers to share his suite. Except the attraction between them only grows in such close quarters?exponentially. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Blake&#39;s incredibly successful--and hot--Caylee&#39;s not sure she can risk her heart again. Not after the way he destroyed her trust when he disappeared years ago. But if she&#39;s wrong in her calculations, she could lose everything...&lt;/p&gt;" />
