  <title>Eating Peaches - Tara Heavey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘&lt;i&gt;Eating Peaches&lt;/i&gt; is a joy to read &amp;ndash; warm, wise and deliciously funny! All in all a real peach. If you&#39;re looking for the perfect summer read, look no further.’&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sarah Webb&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another funny, heartwarming, romantic rollercoaster from well-loved Irish romance writer Tara Heavey.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some people dream of rural life in a pretty little cottage. Not Elena. At 29, she’s a high-flying city lawyer with glossy blonde hair, a wardrobe full of power suits and a top-of-the-range sports car. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And now her silver fox of a boss is promising he’ll give her the promotion of her dreams. But there’s a catch. First, she has to set up a new office for him in his sleepy home town of Ballyknock, hours from the nearest decent double espresso. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elena is horrified at first, but it’s not all bad. For a start, she gets a break from Paul, her germophobic, obsessively tidy boyfriend. And much to her surprise, she discovers Ballyknock is beautiful, and the villagers are warm and welcoming. Better still, the local publican has seven fine sons, including gorgeous Jack and flirtatious Matt. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As she gets to grips with life in a cosy cottage in the middle of nowhere, Elena starts to wonder what her heart really needs. The more time she spends in Ballyknock, the more it seems that true love might wait where she least expects it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
