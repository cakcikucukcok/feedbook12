  <title>Stripped Naked - Desiree Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jinx Malone didn&#39;t expect her first story as publisher of The Hill Country Herald to be a murder. She thought moving from New York to Rowan Country would mean an end to hearing those kinds of calls on the police scanner. The story also puts her up close and personal with the know-it-all new sheriff in town--a man who has more of an effect on her than she&#39;d ever admit to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rowan Country was supposed to be a quieter job where Sheriff Dillon Cross could get over a bad case of burnout. But after only a few weeks on the job, someone finds a dead body in a ditch, and Dillon is butting heads with the sexy local reporter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They get on like two angry hornets trapped in an upturned glass, but soon it&#39;s more than heated barbs they&#39;re exchanging. Of course, their new beginning could be overrun with past mistakes coming back to haunt them both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
