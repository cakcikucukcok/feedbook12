  <title>The Doctor&#39;s Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Marta Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;God could not have chosen a worse time to send Dr. Grant Hardesty to Button Gap. Three abandoned children were depending on Maggie Davis&#39; s clandestine care until their mother returned. Maggie didn&#39; t think she could trust the by-the-book doctor with her secret. Until she got a glimpse into his soul…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and God&#39; s mysterious ways became as clear as a starry night.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maggie knew her trust was well placed as this once-aloof doctor opened his heart to the children… and her. But as Grant&#39; s time in Button Gap ended, she prayed for one more miracle. Could God make this man who seemed to have everything recognize that it all meant nothing without Maggie&#39; s love?&lt;/p&gt;
