      <meta name="description" content="Jack and Dean love each other, but they&#39;re missing the woman to complete their triangle. When newly divorced Paige Richards buys a Bed and Breakfast on Hamlet Island and employs them to help her fix the inn up, Jack and Dean are sure they&#39;ve found the one they&#39;ve been looking for. Despite the playful, sexy clues they drop, luscious Paige is reticent about getting involved, even when they set the stage so she can stumble on them in &lt;i&gt;action&lt;/i&gt;. They can tell by her responses she wants to join them, but rumors travel fast on the small island, and tales of a threesome could get back to the conservative, family vacation crowd who won&#39;t patronize those with an alternative lifestyle. And the last thing they want for Paige is the B&amp;B&#39;s rooms...and her bank account...to remain empty. But Jack and Dean will stop at nothing to prove to Paige that she can have it all...with them." />
