  <title>Billionaire - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His hands went to her panties and he looped his fingers through them, tugging them off her body. Before she had time to comprehend the next move, she felt him lifting her into his arms and laying her down on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their lips met, his tongue dipping inside her mouth. As their tongues clashed together, his hands continued to massage her every curve, gently feeling each part of her sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this point, Marisa stopped feeling self-conscious about her body, and hoped that Jeffrey would explode with desire just like she just did...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After losing her job, Marisa Jamison is elated when she snags a cushy job working at a prestigious law firm. There, she meets gorgeous billionaire, Jeffrey Bradley. There&amp;#39;s only one problem...he&amp;#39;s so rude and arrogant that she wonders if the well-paying job is even worth it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s something intoxicating about Marisa that Jeffrey can&amp;#39;t resist, and he becomes obsessed with her. Is his addiction to Marisa simply the result of a workplace crush, or is he hiding a deep, dark secret?&lt;br /&gt;
