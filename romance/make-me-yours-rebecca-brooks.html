      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Intensely sexy and packs an emotional punch!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lauren Blakely on &lt;i&gt;Make Me Beg&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Collins has always been good--except when it comes to bad boys. Or one bad boy in particular: a tattooed musician as skilled with her body as he is with his guitar. But he wasn&#39;t ready to be a father, so she left him to raise their daughter on her own. Only fate had other plans, and suddenly, Ryan is back in her life, disrupting everything. This time, though, she&#39;s determined not to lose her heart...even if she still craves his touch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan Thomas never expects to see Claire again--especially not in a small mountain town in Washington on the last show of his comeback tour. But when the lights come on, there she is, more beautiful than ever. One incredible night with her won&#39;t be enough... But he&#39;ll have to prove he&#39;s not the man he used to be, if he wants to keep her--and his family--for good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Men of Gold Mountain series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Make Me Stay&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Make Me Beg&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Make Me Want&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Make Me Yours&lt;/p&gt;" />
