      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Handsome men are like kryptonite to Alex, but a husband, kids…trust? Building Never Happened–a cleanup service that erases all evidence of a homicide or suicide–is her main priority. But while being independent, beautiful and successful has its pluses, it&#39;s also pretty lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or was until Alex learns that a high-tech gadget she found at a scene got a detective–and former lover–killed. Now she has mysterious CIA operative Austin Blake shadowing her every move. Caring for her irresponsible mother is hard enough, but toss in a murder investigation… How is she supposed to avoid trouble with Austin and get the job done?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Well, maybe the two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive. After all, isn&#39;t it time Alex stepped back and just let life happen…?&lt;/p&gt;
