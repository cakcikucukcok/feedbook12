  <title>Seven Rainbows Over Santa Rosa - Patrick J.  Saddles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspired by a true story, Seven Rainbows Over Santa Rosa is one man&#39;s unique and serendipitous experience during one of America&#39;s more turbulent times. Set in 1968 in a small Northern California town against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, two very different characters, Captain Sid and Jeff Majors, unleash their wit and shoot-from-the-hip humor over the local airwaves. The music they harvest is a thing to behold. Secretaries and schoolgirls alike swarm these lucky playboys like penguins in mating season. It&#39;s radio romance! Red-hot rock concerts! Woodstock! Altamont! Groupies galore! Thrill to the surprise on-air capers between the fast-living Captain Sid and Jeff, his more practical-minded sidekick. Midstream, the story introduces an intriguing wrinkle, when Jeff finds himself enchanted with a remarkably gifted girl half his age. Their face-to-face meetings produce magical encounters, and Jeff realizes that he loves this teenager like he has never loved anyone before. Yet they are generations apart, and he&#39;s beset by inner turmoil. His instincts keep him on the right path, and he sets himself up for heartbreak.Separated for decades, Jeff ruminates upon his enigmatic relationship with Cindy, the teen princess ... until a phone conversation 30 years later drives him to discover just who she is and what she means to him. Exhilarate in this nostalgic tale&#39;s mystical and spiritual climax." />
