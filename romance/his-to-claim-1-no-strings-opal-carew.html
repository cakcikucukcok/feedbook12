      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From New York Times bestselling author Opal Carew comes the first installment in a red hot erotic mini-series that will rock your world.&lt;br&gt;Rafe Ranier was my boss and secret crush. A rock musician by night and head of a billion dollar empire by day, Rafe could have any woman he wanted. But I was just the shy secretary he never noticed.
