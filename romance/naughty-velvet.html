  <title>Naughty - Velvet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Black Door is a place of forbidden pleasures and where every woman&#39;s fantasy can come to life. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women in the Naughty Book Club - Naomi, Kennedy, Mira and Tyler - will go to any length to satisfy their erotic desires. While they keep that part of their lives a secret, their significant others are harboring secrets of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Naomi, a suburban housewife, is stuck in a loveless marriage and can&#39;t figure out why her husband won&#39;t have sex with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Mira, the seemingly conservative CEO, has a wild side that could ruin not only her professional reputation but also her relationship with Sam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - Kennedy, a flight attendant, is tired of looking for love in the wrong places, but the mystery man seated in first class might be just what she needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; - When Tyler comes home early from her latest design assignment, she discovers her girlfriend in bed with a man, and it is all she can do to keep it together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here they each begin their experience at The Black Door. Once certain truths are revealed, will the shock of knowing destroy relationships, or will they all just &#39;play nice&#39;, and forgive and forget?&lt;/p&gt;" />
