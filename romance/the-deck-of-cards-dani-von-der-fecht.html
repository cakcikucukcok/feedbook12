  <title>The Deck of Cards - Dani Von Der Fecht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is a continuous journey towards our true purpose, a never ending process of learning. This book takes us on a journey in time and distance, as well as a truly spiritual one. 
Janine von Hohenfels is an attractive and gifted young woman. Through countries and continents, tears of laughter and joy, times of passion and despair the reader accompanies her from graduation day to the middle years of her life. 
This is also the story of a very special bond between a man and a woman, challenged by life and stretched to breaking point. Janine encounters love and violence, discovers the price of fame, the meaning of true friendship, the reliability of sisterly love, and the mystical powers of the Red Indian culture. 
Janine shares her life with the golfer and businessman Michael Smith, the actor Tom Hardy and the doctor Christopher Oakland. Lifes challenges take Janine from Germany to England, the USA, Middle America and Canada. And nothing is ever as straight forward as it seems. The Universe has its own way of fulfilling plans and taking us all to our true destinies." />
