  <title>No Letting Go - Anne Rainey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jason Kershaw spots former schoolmate Emma Ryan waitressing at the local pizza place, he decides it&#39;s time to catch up. Trouble is, the pretty, sharp-witted brunette wants nothing to do with him. But he&#39;s not going to let that stop him from trying to chisel through her armor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma lusted after bad boy Jason back in high school, but at a hundred pounds overweight, she was pretty much invisible to popular guys like him. Hard work and determination helped her shed the extra weight--as well as the vulnerable teenager she used to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a business to get off the ground and no desire to let another man toss her aside like yesterday&#39;s trash, charmers like Jason are off her menu. Except the easygoing boy she remembers has become a stubborn, downright mouthwatering man. And Emma&#39;s starving for a taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each novella in the Man-Maid Series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order.&lt;br&gt;Book 1: No Turning Back&lt;br&gt;Book 2: No Letting Go&lt;/p&gt;" />
