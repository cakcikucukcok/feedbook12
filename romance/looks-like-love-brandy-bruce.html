  <title>Looks Like Love - Brandy Bruce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following a break-up with her boyfriend, an unfulfilling career, and a general bad taste in clothes, Kasey Addison feels lost in her own life. With the help of her best friend, Amanda, Kasey embarks on an unexpected journey to rediscover life and love, starting with a whirlwind London jaunt. Surrounded by red telephone booths, double-decker buses, and men in fuzzy black hats, Kasey falls in love with mud baths, Jane Austen, and stone cathedrals. And in the middle of London she meets Lincoln Davis, a Texan with a really great tan, and her life gets even more unrecognizable.
&lt;p&gt;
When her spur-of-the-moment vacation is over, Kasey, a junior marketing consultant, finds herself on the marketing team for LETA, a growing cosmetics company. Kasey&#39;s thrown into the fast-paced world of promotional galas, photo shoots, and magazine interviews. When the owners of LETA decide to release their very first fragrance, Kaseys new assignment is to find out what love looks like and then find a way to sell it. With the help of Amanda and a few new friends, and with a rekindled relationship with the Lover of her soul, Kasey discovers that sometimes love looks like what we least expect.

&quot;Brandy Bruce has penned a fun novel full of laughs, love, and real life. Her wit and voice shine on every page.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--Jenny B. Jones, author of a Katie Parker Production series, a Charmed Life series, and the award-winning novel Just Between You and Me&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With a warm, witty writing style and an adorably self-deprecating heroine, Brandy Bruces Looks Like Love is part travelogue, part survival guide for the lovelorn, and 100 percent fun reading.&lt;br&gt;
