  <title>Chasing Shadows (South Shores, Book 1) - Karen Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The dead still talk if you know how to listen… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every case that Claire Britten cracks is a win, not only professionally but personally. The forensic psychologist has spent a lifetime fighting a neurological disorder, and her ability to conquer it is a testament to her razor-sharp intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nick Markwood is used to winning in the courtroom, so when his latest case is overthrown by Claire&#39;s expert testimony, he can&#39;t help being impressed by her skill. He needs her on the team of his passion project—investigating unusual cases involving mysterious deaths. Her condition doesn&#39;t deter him, and neither does the attraction that sparks between them…even if it should.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they join forces to investigate a murder in St. Augustine, Florida, Claire is thrust into a situation far more dangerous than she&#39;d anticipated, pushing her disorder to a breaking point. Just when she fears she can&#39;t trust her own mind, she discovers Nick&#39;s personal connection to the case—and wonders whether she can trust anyone at all.&lt;/p&gt;
