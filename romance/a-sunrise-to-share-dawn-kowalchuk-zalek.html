  <title>A Sunrise to Share - Dawn Kowalchuk-Zalek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Angela felt the warmth of the sun on her face as the sun rose and sighed. Her life was what she would call better than average. She had a wonderful son, a thriving business, and a comfortable home. As long as she ignored the feeling that there should be something more to life, that something was missing. As long as she ignored the dream that chased her for as long as she could remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Marco, her friend and business partner, was killed by a drunken driver, his nephew arrived to take over the Second Chance Ranch, and Marco&#39;s shares of her business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony sought the sanctuary of the ranch to try to put his own life back together. The death of his uncle was almost more than he could handle. Until he saw his new business partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela and Tony never thought they would see each other again after the summer they spent on the ranch when they were young. Feelings that had begun that summer rushed back the moment they saw each other. Feelings that grew as they raced to meet the rising sun, or lounged by the lake, sharing their thoughts, their fears, their deepest feelings. But Tony&#39;s past and obligations to another stood between them, pulling him away. Would their rekindled love be strong enough to share another sunrise?&lt;/p&gt;" />
