  <title>Burning Moon - Jo Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There&#39;s a very fine line between blushing bride and mascara-streaked sobbing mess. #beenthere &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Lilly Swanson has been planning her perfect life since she was twelve years old: Meet Mr. Right, have the big white wedding, buy a house in the burbs, and raise 2.5 picture-perfect kids. However, when her fiance bails, leaving Lilly alone at the altar to face five hundred gossipy guests, her dream turns into a nightmare. But then Lilly makes an impulsive decision---she ditches the dress, grabs her passport, and heads off to Thailand to spend her honeymoon alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Or so she thinks . . . &lt;br&gt;  Because Lilly quickly learns that everything in Thailand is very hot: the weather, the merchandise, and especially Damien---the sexy, spontaneous man she meets before her feet even hit the sand. Now with no plan, and nothing holding her back, Lilly lets Damien lead her on a wild, unpredictable ride to the world&#39;s most exclusive party, Burning Moon. But after a week of letting go, indulging her every impulse and desire, Lilly must go back to the girl she used to be. Or can Damien convince her that their party doesn&#39;t have to end?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Top Pick! &lt;i&gt;Almost a Bride&lt;/i&gt; put a smile on my face more than once. The dialogue was witty, the words were well-written and the heroine was one-of-a-kind.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;Harlequin Junkie&lt;/i&gt;" />
