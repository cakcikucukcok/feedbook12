        &lt;p&gt;That wasn’t going to be easy. His kiss was just the start of it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cass swallowed a moan. ‘Keep that up and I’ll be screaming.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The thought of being in his arms, all the things that he might do, made her want to scream right now. ‘No, you won’t.’ His body moved against hers, his arm around her waist crushing her tight so that she could feel every last bit of the friction. ‘You’re not going to have breath enough to scream.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s just crisis bonding. That’s what Cass tells herself. It’s just stress and exhaustion from the floods and long nights.&lt;br /&gt;She’s not falling for the gorgeous paramedic she rescued near the river. She’s not thinking about what his skin would feel like under her hands as she patches him up with the first aid kit. She’s not listening to him showering in the next stall.&lt;br /&gt;She’s definitely not thinking about how when she’s around him and his young daughter Ellie she feels like she can finally let herself have the family and love she’d tried so hard to make, and lost. They both think anything they could have would only be temporary— intense and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when her house is flooded and Jack— and adorable Ellie— invite her to share their house, Cass begins to feel like she wants to stay…&lt;/p&gt;
