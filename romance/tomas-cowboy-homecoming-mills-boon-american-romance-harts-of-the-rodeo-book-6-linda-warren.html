  <title>Tomas: Cowboy Homecoming (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (Harts of the Rodeo, Book 6) - Linda Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A Hart’s Greatest Gift&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marine Staff Sergeant Tomas “Tuf” Hart is beginning to understand why they say “you can never go home again.” Still grappling with the mental scars of battle, Tuf’s just learned that Thunder Ranch is in trouble. Now, the Harts are banking everything on their stallion, Midnight, winning the National Finals Rodeo. The only easy part of Tuf’s homecoming was falling for his high school crush all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cheyenne Sundell has always been drawn to Tuf. But as a single mom of twin daughters, she’s wary of getting involved, especially with another military man. Cheyenne’s disastrous marriage taught her that war changed men, and not always for the better. Tuf and Cheyenne have been through hell and back. But with a little hope and a lot of holiday spirit, they just might find a way to heal themselves…and each other.&lt;/p&gt;
