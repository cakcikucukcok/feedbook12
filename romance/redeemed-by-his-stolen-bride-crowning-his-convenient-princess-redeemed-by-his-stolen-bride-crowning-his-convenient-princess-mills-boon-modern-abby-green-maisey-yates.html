          &lt;strong&gt;Redeemed by His Stolen Bride&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Married for revenge…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Having stolen his rival’s fiancée, billionaire Gabriel is blindsided by his powerful attraction to innocent Leonora! He believes he can only offer her passion, but Lenora knows her proud husband could offer so much more than pleasure…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Crowning His Convenient Princess&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;br /&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;His unexpected bride!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nothing surprises prince Gunnar, until personal assistant Latika asks him for help – by marrying her! Recognizing her desperation, he protects her with his royal name. Yet the biggest surprise isn’t their sizzling chemistry, but how dangerously permanent his craving for Latika feels…&lt;/p&gt;
