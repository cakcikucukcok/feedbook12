      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;TO HELP KEEP YOUR EREADER TOPPED UP, ALL TITLES IN THE SERIES ARE ON LOCKDOWN DURING CORONAVIRUS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bargain book bundle &amp;ndash; includes the steamy romance novel &amp;lsquo;Dynasty&amp;rsquo; PLUS &amp;lsquo;Seduction of Taste&amp;rsquo;, an illustrated companion recipe book.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Read the romance &amp;ndash; feel the passion &amp;ndash; taste the love!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A sexy aristocrat. A wild-child inner city cop. A crime wave of passion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Feisty London street cop Shannon Aguerri walks a dangerous line between her methods and justice. After one-too-many maverick missions the bosses lose their nerve. When she&amp;#39;s moved out from the city she rapidly discovers there&amp;#39;s way more going on in the sleepy country village than meets the eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The son of a local aristocrat arouses suspicion of drug crime activity... but his widower father arouses more animal instincts! &amp;nbsp;As a loner Shannon has attracted men but nothing has stuck. When she meets Spencer, the hunky Earl of Bloxington, there is an immediate rapport between them. &amp;nbsp;Already in the mix however, is an upper class rival who has long plotted her way into the Earl&amp;#39;s bed. The jealousy is an evil shade of green and the anger is a violent scarlet. Will she stoop to blackmail to thwart Shannon and Spencer&amp;#39;s romance?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a body is found in a ditch, life in the village turns sinister. Shannon has a hunch. Her instincts point to a local family. She needs conclusive proof and is determined to get it whatever the cost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will Shannon risk her heart and career on yet another high risk unauthorised investigation? Can she get justice for an innocent boy? Dare a kid from the gutter dream of being a countess?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The recipes for love...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Food is the music of love. It sets the tone and the pace. It provides those moments when tastes and textures shared at the table form a metaphor for the physical appetites of love and lust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Seduction of Taste&amp;rsquo; incorporates a total of thirty one recipes and dishes featured in the romance novel &amp;lsquo;Seduction of Dynasty&amp;rsquo;. From appetizers and main courses to suggestions for sandwich fillings at a traditional afternoon tea. Late night suppers and romantic meals for two.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each recipe is a family favorite &amp;ndash; prepared, eaten and enjoyed by the author. There are color illustrations and links from the text of the story to the recipes and from the recipes back in to the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
