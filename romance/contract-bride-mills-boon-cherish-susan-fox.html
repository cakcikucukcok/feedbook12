  <title>Contract Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Susan Fox</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;She was a convenient bride…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Reece Waverly became a widower with an infant son to care for, he turned to Leah Gray. They had a strong friendship and he knew she&#39;d make the perfect wife and mother. It was a convenient marriage–only Reece had no idea Leah had been secretly in love with him for years.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Could she become a wife for real&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leah convinced herself she could live with this arrangement, for the baby&#39;s sake. But after a year she&#39;s forced to admit that she&#39;d hoped to become Reece&#39;s wife in more than name only. On the verge of leaving, Leah is stunned when Reece declares it&#39;s time he claimed her as his bride for real!&lt;/p&gt;
