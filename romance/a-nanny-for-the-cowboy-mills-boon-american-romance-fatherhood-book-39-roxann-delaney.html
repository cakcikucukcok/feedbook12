  <title>A Nanny for the Cowboy (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (Fatherhood, Book 39) - Roxann Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Desperately Seeking A Sitter… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Who knew hiring a nanny could get so complicated? Rancher Luke Walker has been caring for his two-year-old son singlehandedly ever since his wife walked out, and he sure could use some help. But when he thought to find a nanny, he didn’t have someone like gorgeous Hayley Brooks in mind. And he certainly didn’t expect her to move into the ranch house!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hayley is working toward being a Physician Assistant and needs to save money for her classes—and to save on rent by boarding with her employer. She’s delighted that little Braydon warms to her quickly, but is wary of her growing feelings for Luke. It’s a struggle keeping things professional… falling in love with her boss was not part of the job description!&lt;/p&gt;
