  <title>Summer on Lovers&#39; Island - Donna Alward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What happens when a seasonal fling turns into the love of a lifetime? &lt;br&gt;Lizzie Howard&#39;s life has always been adrenaline-charged. Top of her class at Harvard Med and now a gifted trauma doctor, Lizzie&#39;s medical career has always come before rest, relaxation, and especially romance. But when one careless mistake brings her future to a screeching halt, Lizzie&#39;s only chance at reviving it is to temporarily take over a friend&#39;s practice in Jewell Cove. The sleepy Maine coast, a world away from the bustling emergency room Lizzie knows and loves, leaves her feeling more lost than ever-until she meets widowed doctor Joshua Collins, and her heart starts beating a little bit faster... &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Brimming with old family history, small-town secrets, and newfound passion, you&#39;ll want to pack up and move to Jewell Cove, Maine!&quot;&lt;/b&gt; -&lt;b&gt;Lily Everett&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Coming home to Jewell Cove was Josh&#39;s salvation after his wife died. Looking for peace among the familiar faces of friends and family, he&#39;s grateful to work in the town&#39;s small medical clinic by day and spend his nights trying to forget everything he&#39;s lost. Lizzie&#39;s big-city sensibilities are a brash reminder of the world he&#39;s pushed away, but he can&#39;t deny that together they&#39;ve sparked a flame that crackles higher and brighter every day. Maybe love is the best medicine after all ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Wonderful romance, packed with family drama, a sexy hero, an incredible old house. You&#39;ll fall in love from the very first page.&quot;-Debbie Macomber, #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author on &lt;i&gt;The House on Blackberry Hill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
