He&#39;ll do whatever he must to protect the woman who&#39;s captured his heart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney by day, rancher by night Owen McBride conquered his dark past and made it his mission to help the innocent&amp;#8212;even at the expense of a personal life. But when a client&#39;s abusive ex-husband targets Owen and his gorgeous neighbor Claire gets caught in the crossfire, his feelings turn anything but professional. The mysterious beauty awakens something in him, and he&#39;ll move heaven and earth to keep her safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee shop owner Claire Walsh learned the hard way that handsome men aren&#39;t to be trusted. Owen may be sexy as hell and determined to take care of her, but she&#39;s reluctant to put her heart on the line. His presence in her life puts a target on her back, yet the more time she spends with him, the more she finds she can&#39;t help falling for Owen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
