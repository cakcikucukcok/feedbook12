  <title>Invincible (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Diana Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s everything she fears…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and everything she wants&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mercenary by name and by nature, Carson is a Lakota Sioux who stays to himself and never keeps women around long enough for anything emotional to develop. But working with his friend Cash Grier on a complex murder investigation provides Carson with another kind of fun–shocking Cash&#39;s sweet-but-traditional secretary, Carlie Blair, with tales of his latest conquests.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Carlie lands in deep trouble. She saw something she shouldn&#39;t have, and now the face of a criminal is stored permanently in her photographic memory…and Carlie is the key piece of evidence that could implicate a popular politician in the murder case.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her only protection is Carson–the man she once despised. But when she learns that Carson is more than just a tough guy, Carlie realizes she&#39;s endangered herself further. Because now her only chance to live means losing her heart to the most dangerous kind of man….&lt;/p&gt;
