  <title>The Bachelor Meets His Match (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (Chatam House, Book 8) - Arlene James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A Lesson In Love&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tweed-clad professor Morgan Chatam has been the subject of countless student crushes at Buffalo Creek Bible College. But grad student Simone Guilland knows that a relationship with Morgan is out of the question. Even if he weren&#39;t her advisor, the secrets from her past prevent them from having a future. In all his years at BCBC, Morgan has never once felt drawn to one of his students–until Simone. He knows he should keep his distance. Simone deserves someone younger, someone who can give her things he cannot. And yet, he can&#39;t shake the feeling that his chance at happily-ever-after may just lie in her hands.&lt;/p&gt;
