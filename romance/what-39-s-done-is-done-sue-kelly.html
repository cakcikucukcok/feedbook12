  <title>What&#39;s Done Is Done - Sue Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Hurley Family was well respected in their small town of Maple Grove, North Carolina. They operate a large dairy farm. Their son, Charles has decided to help his dad run the business and hadn&#39;t left for &#39;bigger and better things&#39; like his brothers. His best friend since grammar school is still Chad Bennett. They are inseparable.&lt;p&gt;
Beth Hurley accepted the dare. She had agreed to go out with the towns bad boy, Barry Wilkes. Why, she would never know, but now her whole world changed forever. Now her life held a secret she couldn&#39;t share with anyone. How could a loving God allow this to happen? Instead of turning to God, she turned away, and the life she had chosen to live made Beth a bitter woman. Can Beth ever find her way back to forgiveness?&lt;p&gt;
Chad denies any feelings toward Beth. After all she is just his best friend&#39;s little sister.&lt;br&gt;
Circumstances throw them together during an ice storm, and his life is turned upside down." />
