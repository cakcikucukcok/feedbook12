  <title>Roping the Rancher - Sarah M. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Girls his own age don&#39;t quite do it for Tommy Tucker. But when he meets Carly, the manager at a local restaurant, he realizes he&#39;s found just what he was looking for. It&#39;ll take more than a little convincing for the older woman to take him seriously and give them a chance. But Tommy&#39;s ready for more than one go round. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carly has no interest in being anyone&#39;s cougar, and the last time she got involved with a customer, she wound up in a horrible marriage. Not anything she&#39;s interested in repeating. And she doesn&#39;t really trust the fact a young man like Tommy would even look twice at her. Still, when Tommy says he&#39;ll do whatever she tells him to...Carly can&#39;t resist the chance to take what she wants from a man with no strings attached. But no one said anything about tying him up with scarves...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Not My First Rodeo 2 series is a STANDALONE story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in series:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captivating the Cowboy&lt;br&gt;Roping the Rancher&lt;br&gt;Seducing the Sheriff&lt;/p&gt;" />
