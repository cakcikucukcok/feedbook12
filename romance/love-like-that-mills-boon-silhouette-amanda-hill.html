  <title>Love Like That (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Amanda Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Meet Dalton Moss: quick-witted, impulsive, aggressively unambitious; a halfhearted assistant to a Hollywood events planner, she has a penchant for dive bars and abusing her mother&#39;s credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meet Dalton&#39;s boyfriend, Roman: charming, intellectual, worldly; he lands in L.A. just long enough to slip a two-carat diamond on her finger before flying right off again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now meet Dalton&#39;s other boyfriend, Jeremy: perfect in his imperfection, surly in his attraction to her and can match her beer for beer; she doesn&#39;t want to love him, but can&#39;t help herself, despite Roman–and despite Jeremy&#39;s other girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Confused? So is Dalton.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now that she&#39;s engaged, twenty-five-year-old Dalton figures she should temper her fiery, furtive relationship with Jeremy. After all, this is her chance to shed her bad-girl habits and live happily ever after. It&#39;s a no brainer: Roman&#39;s offering a rescue from her drowned existence in L.A. But Jeremy could be her twisted ticket to wonderland. She&#39;s been holding out for a crushing feeling, a love like that, but will she figure out which man she has it with before she loses them both?&lt;/p&gt;
