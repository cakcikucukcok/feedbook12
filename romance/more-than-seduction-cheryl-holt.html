  <title>More Than Seduction - Cheryl Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Anne Smythe&#39;s Healing Spa and Bathing Emporium is a haven for fashionable women who believe the waters have aphrodisiac properties. Yet the prim proprietress never thinks of testing that theory-until grievously injured Captain Stephen Chamberlin is deposited on her doorstep. Every minute the war hero spends under her roof courts scandal. It isn&#39;t long before she discovers that having such a man at her mercy arouses her in ways she never thought possible as their &quot;therapeutic&quot; sessions in the hot springs have become steamy trysts Anne wishes would never end...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen thought he had reached his lowest point when the war rendered him an invalid. He&#39;s proven wrong when his sister and best friend leave him in the care of the tantalizing Mrs. Anne Smythe. Yet as the healing waters work their magic, so does the widow Smythe. Beneath her unflappable exterior lies an alluring woman: warm, witty, and refreshingly open to sensual experimentation. But when mutual pleasure turns to forbidden love, can two people outwit the forces that would see them torn apart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
