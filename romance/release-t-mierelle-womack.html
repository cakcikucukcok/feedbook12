      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Release is a story of passion, troubled romance, deception, and through it all, discovery of self. The protagonist, Tanya Huntingdon, a twentysomething African-American woman, helps herself to more men than servings at Sunday dinner. Once Tanya finally finds the &#39;perfect&#39; guy, the one she has always dreamed about, one who immerses her in his passionate love and &lt;i&gt;challenges&lt;/i&gt; her view of love by waiting to engage in sexual acts, he is relegated to just another victim of Tanya&#39;s capricious pursuit for love when her past love becomes the new hot commodity. But not for long, as she succumbs to an affair set up by her best friend. The trail of man Tanya leaves behind signifies much more than a string of bad decisions, and it is in her search for love that she discovers much more than she bargains for." />
