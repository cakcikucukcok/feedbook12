  <title>When Love Happens - Darcy Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a town as small as Ribbon Ridge and with a family as large as the Archers, even the best-kept secrets don&amp;#39;t stay buried for long...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tori Archer is married&amp;#8230;well, on paper anyway. She hasn&amp;#39;t actually seen her husband since the disastrous morning after their impulsive Vegas wedding. The memories of their intense passion may still make her weak in the knees, but Tori knows their marriage was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months filming abroad, television producer Sean Hennessy wants nothing more than to track down his sexy, captivating wife and get her into bed&amp;#8230;fast. So when his boss sends him to Oregon to persuade the famous Archer sextuplets&amp;#8212;the former stars of a reality TV show&amp;#8212;to do a reunion special, Sean sees the perfect chance to win Tori back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Tori wants nothing to do with him and is determined to push him away. Yet their attraction is as hot as ever and Sean will do anything to prove their relationship was more than just a fling&amp;#8230;because he knows that when real love happens, it changes &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
