  <title>Moon&#39;s Web - C.T. Adams, Cathy Clamp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tony Giodone made his living as an assassin--until one of his marks ripped his throat out and turned him into a werewolf. Now he&#39;s the best hired killer there is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a curvy woman in an expensive suit tries to hire him to kill her, his wolf senses insist that she is his mate. One kidnapping, a plethora of gunfights, a psychic coma, and two faked deaths later, Tony and Sue have new identities and are hiding in a community of Sazi shapeshifters. All seems well, until Sue begins to pull away from Tony and he realizes that if he can&#39;t be more open with her, he&#39;s going to lose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add to his problems, Tony is getting flashes of other peoples&#39; lives. He doesn&#39;t know if they&#39;re memories or fantasies--but he wants it to stop, because he&#39;s learning things he shouldn&#39;t about his friends and neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s more dangerous than a psychic-powered werewolf assassin? Whatever it is, it&#39;s kidnapping and killing female Sazi . . . after it sucks out their powers. Its latest captive is the girlfriend of Carmine, the Mafia don who used to be Tony&#39;s boss. To get her back, Carmine will make war on all the Sazi--and while the Sazi would win, they can&#39;t afford to be exposed to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s up to Tony to save Carmine&#39;s girlfriend--and all of the Sazi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
