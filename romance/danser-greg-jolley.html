  <title>Danser - Greg Jolley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Off the coast of a South American resort, Bill Danser quietly surrenders to the mindless chaos created by too much Tanqueray. As he sits alone on a small boat and burns everything he has ever written, he toasts to the future; his decision is made. A short time later, from inside an airplane, Bill watches the buildings of la Diana slowly fade away, along with his past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to find sobriety, purpose, and love in America, Danser lands in San Francisco and embarks on a road trip across the country in an old Jeep with oversized tires. While striving to maintain his idyllic, simple view of living and loving, Danser travels from Half Moon Bay to a wheat farm in Kansas, where he encounters curious characters and discovers true love with a beautiful woman and her amazing son. As his journey leads him to places he never imagined, Danser is challenged to find meaning, humor, and passion amid the reality that the world is never an easy place. But it is only after tragedy strikes and his life comes full circle that Danser may finally have the chance to realize his dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danser is the poignant tale of one mans misadventures as he travels from South America to Americas heartland in search of sanity, love, meaning, and laughter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
