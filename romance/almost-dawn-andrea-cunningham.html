      <meta name="description" content="An enemy lurks in the shadows
Hes an elf. Nathaniel Papillon, heir to the throne of Mantolpiah, the land of elves, battles a ravenous evil that threatens to destroy the world around him. His newly procured alliance with the High Anarchy of Goosnargh (the land of vampires) is requesting his help in protecting one of their most fierce warriors. Reluctantly, Nathaniel is forced to open his kingdom, and his heart, to the beautiful Cora Knight, whos even more infuriating than she is lethal. His first instincts are to rebuke her, but he soon finds himself trapped between striving to protect her and risking the welfare of his beloved family and kingdom. Nathaniel soon realizes that he would do anything to save her, even if it requires the ultimate sacrificehis life.
And its coming for her
Shes a vampire. Cora Knight, a highly trained warrior who serves the High Anarchy, will stop at nothing to protect her people from the mysterious demons who are now roaming Goosnargh with a violent lust for blood and war. Shes eager to hunt down her enemies and help put an end to their slaughtering trend of madness, but the High Anarchy cannot risk her life on the battlefield. Cora is ordered to return to Mantolpiah, where she loathes the arrogant, handsome Nathaniel Papillon as much as she desires him. Aside from the deranged demons threatening to end her life, Cora is torn between keeping her loyalty to the High Anarchy and her sworn oath to protect her people, and the final chance to pursue happiness. But when fate finds Nathaniel at the mercy of her most brutal enemy, Cora is forced to determine whether her reluctant love is strong enough to save him." />
