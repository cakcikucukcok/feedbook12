        &lt;h2&gt;Introduce yourself to Mills &amp; Boon’s sexiest series yet!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Thing&lt;/em&gt; by Nicola Marsh&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;But after one taste, she’s hooked!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Abby loves her new life working at Sydney’s finest patisserie. Working alongside brooding new man-in-charge Tanner is an unexpected but delicious challenge, especially as each night their attraction only grows hotter! But Tanner’s past is as dark as the ink on his skin… He’ll let her get closer than close in the bedroom, but dare Abby go deeper?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Royal Temptation&lt;/em&gt; by Riley Pine&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;This one plays very, very naughty…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being the Crown Prince means extravagant luxury for Nikolai. Fast cars and faster women. Matchmaker Kate Winter&#39;s job is to chain him down to one woman. Only Kate’s way too tempting – igniting his blood and something far deeper. But Nikolai’s a prince… and his heart is the one crown jewel she can&#39;t have…!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She’s taking control. And it’s driving him wild!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lucy Baudin’s ex dented her self-esteem and it’s time to regain control. In her job as a lawyer she’s bold, confident. But in the bedroom…she needs inspiration to reawaken her inner seductress. Asking her friend Gideon Novak for help seems wrong, yet so deliciously right!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruined&lt;/em&gt; by Jackie Ashenden&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The solution? Mind-blowingly real pleasure!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dane ‘Smoke’ Kingsolver and Cat Livingston need to fake a relationship to get her abusive ex off her back. Convincing people their friendship has heated up to scorching levels is unexpectedly easy! But when their red-hot chemistry threatens to ruin everything they’ve ever known, can they go back to what they had before? And do they even want to?&lt;/p&gt;
