Due to his misguided past as one of the infamous Rakes of St James, Hawk is hoping to avoid the Season by securing a match for her before it begins.  He has the perfect gentleman in mind, but for one infuriating--and unexpectedly intoxicating--obstacle: the intended groom&#39;s own sister, Miss Loretta Quick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having narrowly avoided her own arranged marriage to an unacceptable nobleman, Loretta is determined that her dear brother--a gentle, good-natured soul--should marry for love. Matching wits with Hawk may be her greatest challenge yet. . .until she realizes it may also be her greatest pleasure. For the young duke&#39;s irresistible charm has not only begun to crumble her stubborn resolve, it has claimed her heart in true love as well in &lt;i&gt;To the Duke, With Love. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A master storyteller.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Affaire de Coeur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
