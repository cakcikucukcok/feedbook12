  <title>The Truth About Love and Dukes - Laura Lee Guhrke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Lady Truelove . . . I have fallen in love, truly and completely in love, for the first time. The man whom I hold in such passionate regard, however, is not of my station. He is a painter, a brilliant artist. Needless to say, my family would not approve . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry, Duke of Torquil, wouldn&amp;#8217;t be caught reading the wildly popular &amp;#8220;Dear Lady Truelove&amp;#8221; column, but when its advice causes his mother to embark on a scandalous elopement, an outraged Henry decides the author of this tripe must be stopped before she can ruin any more lives. Though Lady Truelove&amp;#8217;s identity is a closely guarded secret, Henry has reason to suspect the publisher of the notorious column, beautiful and provoking Irene Deverill, is also its author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Irene, it&amp;#8217;s easy to advise others to surrender to passion, but when she meets the Duke of Torquil, she soon learns that passion comes at a price. When one impulsive, spur-of-the-moment kiss pulls her into a scorching affair with Henry, it could destroy her beloved newspaper, her career, and her independence. But in the duke&amp;#8217;s arms, surrender is so, so sweet . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
