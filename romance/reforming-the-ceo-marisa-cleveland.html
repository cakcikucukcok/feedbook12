Before she returns to her stable, boring existence of charity events and dating predictable, stuffy suitors who are only interested in getting closer to the wealthy family who adopted her, she&#39;s going to get a taste of what she&#39;s been missing. She screws up her courage and heads to Vincent Ferguson&#39;s office to find out what all the women in South Beach already seem to know about him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once CEO Vin Ferguson&#39;s tech company goes public, he&#39;ll have proved he&#39;s no longer the poor, gritty kid from the wrong side of the tracks. But, citing his bad boy reputation, some financial backers waver, and his friends suggest dating a more respectable woman to improve his image. Ridiculous. Because delectable but snooty socialites, like his next door neighbor, are way out of his league.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, Reese walks through his office door and makes him an offer. To say his jaw hits the floor is an understatement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he can&#39;t believe what she just proposed...&lt;/p&gt;" />
