      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bethany escapes a crazy doctor&#39;s laboratory, but she&#39;s unable to help Chrissten, the other woman kept captive there. How can she explain to the authorities that during the escape Chrissten shifted into a wolf, and she was kidnapped by the doctor in the first place because she might be part werewolf? Desperate for help and guilt-ridden for leaving Chrissten, her only hope is to find the woman&#39;s twin brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn has been searching for his missing sister without a single clue, until a phone call from a stranger rekindles his hope. Something sparks between Quinn and Bethany when they meet, but he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;ll be a good mate for anyone, let alone someone as gentle as Bethany. He&#39;ll help her through the heat cycle she&#39;s going into, but he can&#39;t offer her a future. Of course, fate and biology might have other ideas...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Legacy series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Alexandra&#39;s Legacy&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Isaiah&#39;s Haven&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Legacy Found&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Quinn&#39;s Quest&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Finding Chrissten&lt;br&gt;Book #6 Damek&#39;s Redemption&lt;br&gt;Book #7 Craig&#39;s Heart&lt;/p&gt;" />
