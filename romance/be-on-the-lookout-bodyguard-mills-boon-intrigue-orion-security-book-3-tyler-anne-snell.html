  <title>Be On The Lookout: Bodyguard (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Orion Security, Book 3) - Tyler Anne Snell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Protecting a woman who claimed she didn&#39;t need a bodyguard made his final case the most interesting of his career…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before he settles down behind the desk, Orion Security bodyguard Jonathan Carmichael has one last assignment. One that might prove to be more than he bargained for. Becasue Kate Spears is adamant she doesn&#39;t need his protection. And a woman who doesn&#39;t want a bodyguard could be difficult, dangerous–and terribly intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kate was used to taking care of herself. Unfortunately, her most recent scientific discovery made someone intent on taking her research and her life. Now, only one man stood between her and death. And while Jonathan was more than capable of protecting her body, she feared he could be the one man to wreck havok on her very soul.&lt;/p&gt;
