  <title>Scarred Souls: Raze &amp; Reap - Tillie Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first two books in the Scarred Souls series, in one volume!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RAZE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One man stripped of his freedom, his morals... his life. Conditioned in captivity to maim, to kill and to slaughter, prisoner 818 becomes an unrivaled and unstoppable fighter in the ring. Violence is all he knows. After years of incarceration in an underground hell, only one thought occupies his mind: revenge... bloody, slow and violent revenge. Revenge on the man who wronged him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kisa Volkova is the only daughter of Kirill &#39;The Silencer&#39; Volkov, head of the infamous &#39;Red&#39; bosses of New York&#39;s Russian Bratva. Her life is protected. In reality, it&#39;s a virtual prison. Her father&#39;s savage treatment of his rivals and his lucrative and coveted underground gambling ring-The Dungeon-ensures too many enemies lurk at their door. She dreams to be set free. Kisa has known only cruelty and loss in her short life. While working for her church-the only reprieve in her constant surveillance-Kisa stumbles across a tattooed, scarred, but stunningly beautiful homeless man on the streets. Something about him stirs feelings deep within her; familiar yet impossibly forbidden desires. He doesn&#39;t talk. Doesn&#39;t communicate with anyone. He&#39;s a man beyond saving. But Kisa becomes obsessed with him. Yearns for him. Craves his touch. Needs to possess this mysterious man... ... this man they call Raze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;REAP &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raised as a prototype for the Georgian Bratva&#39;s obedience drug, 221 fails to think, act or live for himself; his master&#39;s perfectly-crafted killing puppet. Standing at six foot six, weighing two-hundred and fifty pounds, and unrivalled in to-the-death combat, 221 successfully secures business for, the Georgian Mafiya Boss of NYC, in the dark world of the criminal underground. Until his enemies capture him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Tolstoi dreams to break from the heavy clutches of Bratva life and dreams of another life-away from the stifling leash of her Russian Bratva Boss father, from the brutality of her work at &lt;i&gt;The Dungeon&lt;/i&gt;-her criminal family&#39;s underground death match enterprise. But when she stumbles upon her family&#39;s captive who is more monster than man, she starts to see the man underneath. A powerful, beautiful, damaged man whose heart calls to hers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
