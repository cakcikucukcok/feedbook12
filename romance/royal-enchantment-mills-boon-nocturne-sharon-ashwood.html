  <title>Royal Enchantment (Mills &amp; Boon Nocturne) - Sharon Ashwood</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;She married the king. She wanted the man.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Guinevere&#39;s marriage to Arthur was a political partnership, never a romance. Merlin knows that the king&#39;s court, newly restored at a medieval theme park, will only be complete if Arthur has his lady. Little did anyone suspect that once Guinevere gets a taste of twenty-first-century freedoms that this ancient queen would lose interest in belonging to any man – even a royal one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It takes a dragon and passionate nights spent in each other&#39;s arms to lure her back to her husband&#39;s side. Arthur is willing to accept Gwen&#39;s help in protecting the new Camelot from a fae menace, but the bigger challenge will be wooing back Guinevere for a second chance at love…&lt;/p&gt;
