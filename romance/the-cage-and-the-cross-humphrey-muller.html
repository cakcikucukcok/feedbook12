  <title>The Cage and the Cross - Humphrey Muller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like James Joyce&#39;s character, Stephen Daedalus, Denton searches deeply into his soul, seeking to communicate and understand the consciousness of his race. Questioning his reason for living, Denton preaches the Gospel to prisoners in Pretoria Central Prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author&#39;s blending of narrative and stream of consciousness, interspersed with poetic epiphany, captures the complex climate of Denton&#39;s spiritual journey. The author writes on a high, dramatic level, never in danger of losing the tension of a conflict that leads his character away from a fundamentalist belief in Christian doctrine to a wider acceptance of Christ and salvation through grace.&lt;/p&gt;
