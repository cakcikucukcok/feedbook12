  <title>How to Seduce an Angel in 10 Days - Saranna DeWylde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Got Angel?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drusilla &quot;Tally&quot; Tallow does. Both fallen and otherwise because she&#39;s got ten days of Heavenly and Infernal Parole after knocking Falcon Cherrywood from his broom. All she wanted was to settle down with a nice warlock, have babies, and grow old together. But she&#39;s got a bad habit of falling for the wrong warlock. She blames Cupid. Too bad her Heavenly Parole Officer is none other than the heart bandit himself--the newly appointed Cupid and current fixture in all her fantasies, Falcon Cherrywood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After smiting Cupid with a fireball, Falcon Cherrywood must now play the Diapered Archer. He can&#39;t think of anything more humiliating than flying around in pink wings shooting arrows into hopeless fools. Archery was never his strong suit and Falcon doesn&#39;t even believe in love. But more troubling are the feelings his sinfully irresistible parolee sets off in him--for only Tally has the power to make him believe in things better left to fairy tales, like Happily Ever After. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; Praise for Saranna DeWylde&#39;s Novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Brash, sexy and funny as hell.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Angie Fox&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Funny, sexy, and wild!&quot; --Cynthia Eden&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Grace + Caspian = LOL demonic lovin&#39; fun!&quot; --Dakota Cassidy, author of The Accidental Series" />
