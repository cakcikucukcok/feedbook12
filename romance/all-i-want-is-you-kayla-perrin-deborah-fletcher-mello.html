  <title>All I Want Is You - Kayla Perrin, Deborah Fletcher Mello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Romance was the last thing on their minds--until the holidays brought these two women face to face with the men of their dreams.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Holiday Seduction Kayla Perrin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mikki Harper isn&#39;t looking forward to going home for her sister&#39;s wedding--especially since she&#39;s just been dumped. Then she runs into &quot;Boring Barry&quot; from high school and soon the two are catching up on old times--and Mikki discovers Barry is anything but boring. Mikki doesn&#39;t expect to see him again, especially not at a dinner hosted by the groom&#39;s family. It turns out Barry wants to relive their fling. But will Mikki run into his arms--or back to her ex, who&#39;s suddenly had a change of heart? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; Her Holiday Gifts Deborah Fletcher Mello&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commissioned to bake a towering cake for the Whitman Corporation&#39;s CEO at their New Year&#39;s extravaganza--Malisa Ivey is mortified when she gets trapped inside. Even worse, the cake is then transported--with Malisa inside--to Gabriel Whitman&#39;s office. The sexy business tycoon is shocked when a beautiful woman pops out of his dessert--and can&#39;t help but wonder what it would be like to have such sweetness in his life all year.  .  ." />
