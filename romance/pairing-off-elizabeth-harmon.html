  <title>Pairing Off - Elizabeth Harmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="American figure skater Carrie Parker&#39;s Winter Games dreams were dashed when her philandering partner caused one of the greatest scandals in skating history. Blacklisted from competing in the United States, her career is over&amp;#8230;until she receives a mysterious invitation and is paired with the most infuriating, talented&amp;#8212;and handsome&amp;#8212;skater she&#39;s ever met.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Russian champion Anton Belikov knows sacrifice. He gave up a normal life and any hope of a meaningful relationship to pursue his dream. And he&#39;s come close&amp;#8212;with a silver medal already under his belt, the next stop is the gold. All he needs is a partner. While he&#39;s never forgotten the young American skater he seduced one long-ago night in Amsterdam, he never expected to be confronted with their past&amp;#8230;never mind share the ice with her.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When what starts as a publicity stunt grows into something real, Carrie and Anton&#39;s partnership will test their loyalties to family, country and each other. With only a few months to train for the competition of a lifetime, can they master technique &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; their emotions, or will they lose their footing and fall victim to the heartaches of their pasts?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;96,000 words" />
