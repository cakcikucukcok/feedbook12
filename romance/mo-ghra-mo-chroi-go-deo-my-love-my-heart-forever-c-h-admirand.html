  <title>Mo Ghra Mo Chroi Go Deo (My Love My Heart Forever) - C.H. Admirand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Lord of Merewood Keep/Bk 1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.H. Admirand sweeps her readers back into the past to Medieval England with her Mo Ghr&amp;aacute; Mo Chro&amp;iacute; Go Deo Series beginning with book 1: The Lord of Merewood Keep. This re-release has been re-edited and freshened up. For readers who have already read this Medieval series, I have changed the love scenes to appeal to a broader range of readers, by giving Lady Jillian and Garrick of Merewood their privacy during those intimate moments. Never fear, the romance is still the most important part of Lady Jillian and Garrick of Merewood&amp;#39;s story. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A marriage arranged for freedom and a dowry not of gold, but of honor. Garrick of Merewood&amp;rsquo;s vows are tested, and Lady Jillian&amp;rsquo;s life had been threatened. Love and trust must overcome deceit and treachery if they are to survive. Together they must stand against her guardian, and their King, to find the love of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saxon Bride/Bk 2:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.H. Admirand sweeps her readers back into the past to Medieval England with her Mo Ghr&amp;aacute; Mo Chro&amp;iacute; Go Deo Series with book 2: The Saxon Bride. This re-release has been re-edited and freshened up. For readers who have already read this Medieval series, I have changed the love scenes to appeal to a broader range of readers, by giving Lady Eyreka and Augustin de Chauret their privacy during those intimate moments. Never fear, the romance is still the most important part of Lady Eyreka and Augustin de Chauret&amp;#39;s story. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Merewood Keep is just beginning to earn revenues with Garrick as it&amp;rsquo;s overlord. When the new Norman King decides to gift the newly rebuilt keep to one of his favored knights, his mother Eyreka is devastated until she hears the rumors that the Norman is widowed. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Augustin de Chauret has no desire to marry, nor live in England. But his liege lord has gifted him with a keep and now a wife. Will the Saxon beauty win his heart as well as his name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Scot&amp;#39;s Honor/Bk 3:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.H. Admirand sweeps her readers back into the past to Medieval England with her Mo Ghr&amp;aacute; Mo Chro&amp;iacute; Go Deo Series with book 3: A Scot&amp;rsquo;s Honor. This re-release has been re-edited and freshened up. For readers who have already read this Medieval series, I have changed the love scenes to appeal to a broader range of readers, by giving Genvieve de Chauret and Scot&amp;rsquo;s Mercenary Winslow MacInness their privacy during those intimate moments. Never fear, the romance is still the most important part of Genvieve and Winslow&amp;#39;s story. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Scot&amp;rsquo;s Mercenary Winslow MacInness rescues a Norman beauty, but how can he help her find her way home if she cannot speak? While waiting for her to recover, MacInness discovers a woman he can love, one who can replace the woman he can never have, his overlord&amp;rsquo;s wife. &amp;nbsp;But marriage to Genvieve isn&amp;rsquo;t part of his plan until he discovers her life is still in danger and the only way to protect her is to marry her. But will he survive the attempts on his life? Is Genvieve de Chauret behind those attempts?&lt;/p&gt;" />
