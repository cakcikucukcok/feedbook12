  <title>Long, Tall Cowboy Christmas - Carolyn Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This goes down like a cup of hot cocoa--warm and sweet.&quot; --&lt;i&gt; Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A heartwarming holiday read from &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Carolyn Brown&lt;br&gt;  Nash Lamont is a man about as solitary as they come. That&#39;s exactly why ranch life in middle-of-nowhere Happy, Texas suits him. So what the heck is he doing letting a beautiful widow and her three rambunctious children temporarily move in? Before he knows it, they&#39;re stringing Christmas lights and decorating the tree... and he&#39;s having the time of his life. But after everything he&#39;s been through, Nash knows this kind of happiness doesn&#39;t last.&lt;br&gt;  Kasey Dawson thought she&#39;d never get over the death of her husband. Nash, with his strong hands and infinite patience, is stirring something she hasn&#39;t felt in a long time. Kasey knows the sexy cowboy isn&#39;t telling her everything about this past, though. And she refuses to risk heartbreak all over again. But her kids have a plan of their own: Nothing will keep them from having a real family again-even if it takes a little help from Santa himself.&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Genuinely sweet.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
