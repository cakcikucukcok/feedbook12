  <title>Midnight Heat MM Alpha Omega Fated Mates Mpreg - Jade DragonSong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was hot. Too hot. This damned Phoenix heat was getting me down. And now that my own heat had come upon me, I needed relief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking a walk in the middle of the night to clear my head, I saw that a new nightclub had opened up near me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to be the only omega in the place. The only one in heat, that is. Every alpha worth his salt hit on me. Just as I&amp;rsquo;d turn down one, another would take his place. It was a nightmare!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there was one alpha who left me alone. The one that didn&amp;rsquo;t chase me was the one I wanted. Badly. But would he be interested in me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fate had surely brought us together&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But before I knew it, he was gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I didn&amp;#39;t even know his name." />
