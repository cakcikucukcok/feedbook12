  <title>Strive to Succeed - Cherrill Clough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rachel Anderson is stunning to look at, dresses beautifully, and has a warm personality with a winning smile. 
Having worked in a top job in finance in Brisbane, answered an advert for a similar job at the Gold Coast, she was successful. 
When she met young entrepreneur James Sergeant, her new boss, he asked if she would take on the challenge learning to read, write, and speak Chinese. Business was now in the Chinese market, and they needed a front person who could speak fluently. Rachel took on the challenge within three months, doing as James had asked.
When they arrived in Hong Kong for a charity function, James introduced her to his best friend, Blake. Fireworks were definitely going off between the two of them. Blake had started a charity for kids off the streets in Hong Kong. 
When he arrived three years prior, he found kids being kicked, pushed, and beaten to move on from shop fronts in the morning where they slept, not one person offering a cent to get food. Blake was horrified by this, so he decided to do something about it, endearing himself to the Chinese people.
Blake had set up a display of what he had envisaged for the kids off the streets, with the crme de la crme of China attending the function. They paid millions toward this dream of this young Australian who wanted to do good for their unwanted children. 
During the following twelve months, his dream came to fruition, and as did his love for Rachel. He and James discussed their situation of both loving the same girl. James knew he would have to bow out gracefully. This story is heartfelt and gives good relations between two totally different countries as well as how people can come together for the right cause. Look after the children. They are our future." />
