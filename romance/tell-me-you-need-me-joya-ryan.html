This book can very obviously be read as a standalone, and I'm going to bet the others in the series can as well. It told from a third person POV between the hero and heroine. There is an HEA, and no cliffhanger! This was one of those stories that stuck with me.<br /><b><i>Tell Me You Need Me (Search and Seduce #1) by Joya Ryan</i></b> | Tell Me You Need Me Paperback – November 14, 2015 by Joya Ryan (Author) › Visit Amazon's Joya Ryan Page.
