The more they talk to each other the more they start liking one another When their jobs allow them to finally meet face to face after months of talking on the phone will they take a leap of faith by taking their relationship to the next level or will the color of their skin make them not want to risk the challenges they know they will have to confront. Is the love they share strong enough to stand the test of time between all the people in their lives starting from the secretary, to the friends, and last but not least the family?" />
