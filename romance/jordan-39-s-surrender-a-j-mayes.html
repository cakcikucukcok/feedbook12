  <title>Jordan&#39;s Surrender - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jordan is a young woman struggling to control her need to experience devasting pain. No longer able to orgasm with conventional sex, Jordan knows she has to find a man capable of delivering the control and pain she desperately needs. On a ski trip, she meets Ben and sensing the deep need within the beautiful Jordan, he introduces her to the world of extreme BDSM, training her to be his slave. In his dungeon, Jordan embraces the pain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ben leaned close, and whispered, &amp;ldquo;Join me in the suite for a drink.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you asking?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, Jordan &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then there&amp;rsquo;s no need for me to answer,&amp;rdquo; Jordan said, lowering her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nope. You want a man to tell you what to do. Don&amp;rsquo;t you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;Feeling dampness between her legs, Jordan squirmed in her chair. &amp;ldquo;Y-yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;ll do everything I tell you?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her throat constricted and arid like desert sand, Jordan nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;See that you do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hearing his command, Jordan&amp;rsquo;s smoldering eyes gazed into the dark coals looking back, and hoping he was the man who would finally fulfill her dark, and dangerous needs, she shivered. Ben read the urgency in her eyes and pulling his wallet out, dropped cash on the table. &amp;ldquo;Time to go,&amp;rdquo; Ben said, his voice firm.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her body slightly trembling, Jordan prayed Ben didn&amp;rsquo;t notice as he took her arm, leading her to the elevators up to his floor. Entering the suite, Ben said, &amp;ldquo;Jordan, take your clothes off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;N-now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a request. You want this.&amp;rdquo; Ben took her face in his hands, his fingers squeezing slightly. &amp;ldquo;Take your clothes off. Now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jordan stepped back, and unzipping her sweater, slid it off her shoulders and down her arms, then removed her snow boots, leggings and socks. Standing naked in front of Ben, she looked at the floor, her heart racing in her chest as she waited for his next order.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Look at me and spread your legs,&amp;rdquo; Ben said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flinching at the tone of his voice, Jordan looked up shyly and did as he commanded." />
