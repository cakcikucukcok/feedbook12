      <meta name="description" content="Kacie Buckingham desperately needs some time to put her pre-wedding jitters to rest. She spontaneously decides to take a few days and go white water rafting.  What she expected was a few days of rest, relaxation and reflection.  Instead she encounters a breathtakingly gorgeous tour guide and some haunting memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Mason Cash enjoys his job, but has to make changes to accommodate his family&#39;s needs. His last rafting expedition is more than he expects when he meets Kacie. She&#39;s beautiful and intriguing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Instantly Mason and Kacie feel an attraction towards one another.  Will this little adventure down the Colorado be the distraction they both need or the beginning of something neither expected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Can these two find true love before they are devoured by the waves separating them? Will they be able to overcome the obstacles; her past and his family? Not to mention the ring on her hand and hundreds of miles they live apart." />
