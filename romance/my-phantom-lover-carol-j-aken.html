  <title>My Phantom Lover - Carol J. Aken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lizzie was born into a rough life, and everyone thinks she will forever be a prisoner of her own lack of opportunities. Fighting for every small advantage wears on her young soul, leaving her filled with doubt, insecurity, and a complete lack of self-respect.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But despite the many challenges she faces, Lizzie never loses sight of a better life. She puts her nose to the grindstone, and she works her way through college as a model. Inspired by his sisters success, her brother works hard to catch the eye of college football scouts, and he too finds a future with his abilities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But despite the seemingly glamorous life she now leads, Lizzie feels an emptiness within her heart. Shes let the love of her life slip through her fingers, and now she is once again struggling to keep her eye on the prize despite the pain in her heart. A tragic death darkens the lives of everyone she knows, and things are only going to get worse. When tragedy rips her world apart, Lizzie fights for what she knows and loves. &lt;/p&gt;" />
