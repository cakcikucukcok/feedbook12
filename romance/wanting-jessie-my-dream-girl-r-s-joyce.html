  <title>Wanting Jessie, My Dream Girl - R.S. Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When 13-year-old Rusty accepts his brothers invitation to ride in his Camaro with him one night, Rusty has no idea he is about to meet the girl of his dreams in a local body shop. When he sees cute Jessie Brown working on an old car, it is love at first sight for Rusty. Now all he has to do is convince her that she is his only true love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rustys goal to make Jessie a part of his life is more challenging to achieve than he ever imagined. He and Jessie live far apart, he is not old enough to drive, and Jessie is difficult to get to know. Still, as he matures, he does not give up his pursuit of Jessie, even as he discovers his passionate sidewith the help of other girls. When Jessie finally agrees to date him, Rusty can hardly believe his luck. As he attempts to open her heart, Rusty recognizes a need deep within himself that he knows only she can satisfy. Will he be able to break through her barriers and realize true love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this erotic, heartfelt love story, a teenage boy matures into a man while on a seven-year quest to convince his dream girl that they are meant to be together.&lt;/p&gt;" />
