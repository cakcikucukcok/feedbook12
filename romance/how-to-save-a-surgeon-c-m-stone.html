  <title>How to Save a Surgeon - C. M. Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When he lost the girl he loved, Dr. Jackson DeMatteo shut down his heart and became the kind of perfectionist surgeon that alienated him from the residents. Now Jackson has a very coveted promotion dangling before him...but it comes with a price. Working with adorably geeky first-year resident Darla Morales is definitely going to cost him. Big time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;She&#39;s just what the doctor ordered...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Completing her trauma residency demands confidence and Darla, who&#39;s already pretty high on the nerd scale, is definitely not confident. Worse still, she&#39;s forced to work with Doctor Dreamy, who makes her even more nervous and defensive. Darla needs to focus on the work and not his bedroom eyes if she ever hopes to become a trauma surgeon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Gambling Hearts series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 One Night in Vegas&lt;br&gt;Book #2 How to Save a Surgeon&lt;/p&gt;" />
