  <title>Kidnapped Seduction - Michelle White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Katherine Portienne (Kate), an innocent mid-western college graduate, lands her dream job in Los Angeles, she doesn&#39;t realize what kind of a ride she was in for... literally. Tonight wasn&#39;t the first time that she&#39;d worked twelve hours straight since she took on the Junior Associate position at the law firm of Johnson, Smith, and Barnes, and she knew that it wouldn&#39;t be the last. Kate had big plans to remove the Junior in her title and do it fast. Matter of fact Kate had everything in her life planned and nothing, especially a man, was going to get in her way... or so she thought. However, she never expected that she would be kidnapped in her own car. Suddenly, she finds herself trapped with a desperate man on a mission... What follows is a seductive and passionate journey across country, as Kate faces the harsh reality that everything she thought she wanted in life, had now changed." />
