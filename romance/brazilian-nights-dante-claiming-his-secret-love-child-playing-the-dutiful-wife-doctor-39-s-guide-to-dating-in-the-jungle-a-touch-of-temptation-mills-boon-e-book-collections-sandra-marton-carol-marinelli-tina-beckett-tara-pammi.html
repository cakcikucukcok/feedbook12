        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dante: Claiming His Secret Love-Child&lt;/strong&gt; by Sandra Marton&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabriella Ramos-Viera fell for Dante&#39;s raw masculinity and ended up pregnant and alone–with no choice but to return home in shame.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tough corporate raider Dante Orsini has set his sights on a huge Brazilian ranch. However, he discovers it&#39;s to be inherited by Gabriella, the one woman he&#39;s never been able to forget…. But where&#39;s the New York career woman he once knew? And who&#39;s the dark-haired little boy who calls her Mommy?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing the Dutiful Wife&lt;/strong&gt; by Carol Marinelli&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Learning that the husband she&#39;d tried to forget has spent the past year falsely imprisoned in Brazil and needs her to visit him is the last thing Meg Hamilton wants to hear. But she will play her part, in exchange for Niklas&#39;s signature on the divorce papers!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Except she hadn&#39;t bargained on their mind-blowing connection being as undeniable as ever. Last time it led usually sensible Meg into a Vegas wedding chapel. This time the consequence of giving in to their chemistry will bind her to Niklas forever….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor&#39;s Guide to Dating in the Jungle&lt;/strong&gt; by Tina Beckett&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Rule #1–Don&#39;t flirt with your boss!&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Stevie Wilson knows the rules–but in Brazil, in the confines of their medical boat, she&#39;s finding it virtually impossible to keep away from her lethally attractive boss, Dr. Matt Palermo. Even their hammocks are on top of one another!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Rule #2–Apply ridiculous amounts of insect repellent.&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This one&#39;s easier to follow, but that won&#39;t help to banish thoughts of the hunky Matt….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rule #3&lt;/em&gt; is the biggest challenge of all–&lt;em&gt;Never fall for a man who has buried his heart deep in the Amazon jungle!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Touch of Temptation&lt;/strong&gt; by Tara Pammi&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cool, calm and collected CEO Kimberly Stanton is following hot on the heels of her scandalous sister Olivia. Not only has she revealed her (very sudden!) pregnancy, but she has rocked the international business world with the shock announcement of her marriage to outrageous Brazilian bad-boy-tycoon Diego Pereira!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If rumours of huge blowout arguments, bailout money for Kim&#39;s company and dark secrets are already besetting society&#39;s most notorious couple, who can say what lies ahead for these two lovers? One thing&#39;s for sure—it&#39;ll be so much fun watching!&lt;/p&gt;
