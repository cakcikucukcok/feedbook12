  <title>Wedding Promises (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Sophie Pembroke, Jennifer Faye, Annie O&#39;Neil</title>

        &lt;h2&gt;A vow to bind them!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slow Dance with the Best Man&lt;/em&gt; by Sophie Pembroke&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shy Eloise Miller has hidden from attention since her mother&#39;s scandalous affairs destroyed her family. So having to act as maid of honour in a glitzy celebrity wedding is her worst nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the glare of the world&#39;s media, she&#39;s paired with best man Noah Cross. On paper, this commitment-phobic Hollywood heart-throb is everything Eloise avoids. But soon he&#39;s unlocking Eloise&#39;s secret hopes, and tempting her to believe that her dreams of forever might come true.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal for the Wedding Planner&lt;/em&gt; by Sophie Pembroke&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Millionaire’s Royal Rescue&lt;/em&gt; by Jennifer Faye&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Millionaire Grayson Landers travels to the island of Mirraccino to escape the paparazzi. But after rescuing the king’s niece, Lady Annabelle DiSalvo, from a thief he’s thrown into a new media storm. Helping Annabelle’s his chance for redemption, but he won’t risk his heart again…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Married for His Secret Heir&lt;/em&gt; by Jennifer Faye&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elena Ricci has always had a crush on Earl Luca DiSalvo—with his dark and stormy eyes, his protective nature and his royal bearing, who wouldn&#39;t? But she believed they were destined to only ever be friends, until one magical evening in Paris…that has dramatic consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tempted by the Bridesmaid &lt;/em&gt;by Annie O’Neil&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;he last time brooding Italian surgeon Luca Montovano saw bubbly heiress Francesca Martinelli was at his best friend&#39;s failed wedding. Sparks flew then, and now she&#39;s made a surprise appearance at his mountaintop clinic, bringing a much-needed whirlwind of laughter!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claimnig His Pregnant Princess&lt;/em&gt; by Annie O’Neil&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Face-to-face with the man she&#39;d loved and lost two years ago, Dr. (and Princess) Bea di Jesolo knows she has no right to forgiveness, but she hopes they can call a truce for the sake of their patients.Could he risk his heart again—especially when he discovers her secret?&lt;/p&gt;
