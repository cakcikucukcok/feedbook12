          &lt;strong&gt;A mysterious stranger has come to town…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Former cop, Mac Cordero, was going undercover one last time to find and extract revenge on the man who fathered, then abandoned him. All he knew was that the man&#39;s name was McBride–a name, he discovered, that was synonymous with scandal in the small town of Honoria, Georgia. Which was jut was well…because Mac intended to raise a little hell!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;…and he wants her!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Responsible, reliable Sharon Henderson was drawn to the sexy-as-sin stranger the moment he drove into town. Dark and dangerous, he made her feel carefree, reckless…and very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; desired. She couldn&#39;t help falling for him, hard and fast. Then she discovered that their love was based on a lie…&lt;/p&gt;
