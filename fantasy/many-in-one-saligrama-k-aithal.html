  <title>Many in One - Saligrama K. Aithal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The short stories in the collection &quot;Many in One&quot; seek to build bridges across countries and cultures. A product of globalization, they have literary ancestry in both the eastern and the western hemispheres. While giving the final touches to the preparations for his own prospective death and cremation, Madhav, the common protagonist of the stories, receives a call from his daughter in the United States telling him that she has obtained all the necessary documents for his emigration from India to the US and that he must join the family in the US at the earliest. Down goes the drain all his plans and preparations, and, on his relocation, his preoccupation with death gives way to the pursuit of happiness, not only for himself but for the world. The stories in the volume describe the numerous roles he assumes fitting the title &quot;Many in One&quot; to promote peace and understanding among people. Madhav appropriates even the role of the writer and claims he is the true author of the stories in the collection. With the single mission of removing walls and giving the right of choice of salvation for all and a free pass to all to heaven in a democratic spirit, Madhav talks about religion, literature, music and business. Assuming one role after another, Madhav waltzes the reader through the chaos of the world, building bridges across cultures and between nations. Simultaneously serious, lighthearted and witty, the stories should appeal to a wide spectrum of audience-- from the general reader to students and teachers of literature." />
