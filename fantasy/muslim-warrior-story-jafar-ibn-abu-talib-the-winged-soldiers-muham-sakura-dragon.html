      <meta name="description" content="Jafar ibn Abi Talib (c.590-629 CE), also known as Jafar al-Tayyar, was a companion of prophet Muhammad and an older brother of Ali. Jafar was the third son of Abu Talib ibn Abdul Muttalib and Fatima bint Asad, hence a cousin of Muhammad.  When there was a drought in Mecca, Abu Talib could not afford to support his family. His brother Abbas therefore took charge of the young Jafar. Jafar was an early convert to Islam. He married Asma bint Umays, who converted to Islam in 614-615.  When the Muslims were harassed in Mecca, several of them migrated to Abyssinia. Jafar joined the second flight in 616. There they obtained the protection of the Negus, Ashama ibn Abjar, and could worship God unhindered. Jafar and Asma lived in Abyssinia for about twelve years." />
