  <title>Mooneyes and the Dark Moon Council - I. L. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was said that the eyes of moon elves glowed with the light of their gods both during the day and the night. This was a blessing for the moon elves. However, Karuks eyes did not glow, for they were as black as night, and the elders had believed his heart would be just as dark. He was born bigger and stronger and with light-colored hair. The elders debated whether or not to take this young elf to the woods and leave him to die. This way the darkness within him would die with him. However, fate had its own plans, and the elves decided to raise the child within the camp in hopes that the darkness would fade from him and the blessing of the elves would fall on him before he became a man.
That same night, Jimni and Dawgknight were born. Jimnis cub was a gray saber-toothed wolf with eyes that glowed green. He named the cub Emerald. Dawgknights cub was a saber-toothed tiger with fur as black as the darkest night and eyes that glowed light blue. He named his cub Soul. After they and their pets where trained, they began their brotherly competitions with each other. They competed so much that they even had a bet that the loser would have to name his firstborn son after the one who was knighted first." />
