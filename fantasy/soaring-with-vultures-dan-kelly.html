  <title>&quot;Soaring with Vultures&quot; - Dan Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Soaring with Vultures&amp;rdquo; by Dan Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In post-Civil War Missouri, killing was the way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the echoes of Rebel gunshots only recently silenced in Kentucky and his near-fatal chest wound still healing, Union Colonel William A. Warner moved his wife and children to a new land in hopes of finding peace and prosperity. Instead, he discovered that violence remained rampant in Lafayette County, Missouri, where his dreams of a new life turned into a family nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Soaring with Vultures&amp;rdquo; presents a fictional account of a real 1868 killing that nearly tore&amp;nbsp; the Warner family asunder. It captures an era rent by lynchings, bushwhackers, and political strife&amp;mdash;remnants of the Civil War&amp;mdash;and shows how the ubiquitous violence ensnared even the most upstanding of families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is told through the eyes of Colonel Warner&amp;rsquo;s son, Leslie, whose openness and youthful idealism are repeatedly put to the test. He has a front-row seat for the family drama involving his sister, Sallie, who marries Missourian Sam Nutter, only to find he&amp;rsquo;s a drunk, a thief, and a liar. After she files for divorce, Sam launches a campaign of terror against the Warners that culminates in a fatal shooting and a first-degree murder trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A contentious divorce, a thirst for revenge, and suspenseful courtroom drama&amp;mdash;all tantalizing elements in Dan Kelly&amp;rsquo;s debut novel, set against the backdrop of tumultuous post-Civil War Missouri. Kelly has skillfully blended fact and fiction in a story filled with colorful characters, absorbing history, and riveting action that will keep you turning pages from first to last.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrea Warren, author of &amp;ldquo;The Boy Who Became Buffalo Bill: Growing Up Billy Cody in Bleeding Kansas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kelly captures the turmoil and chaos of post-Civil War Missouri&amp;mdash;told through the eyes of a young idealist who discovers that betrayal and violence have come to torture his own family. Fans of historical fiction are going to like this one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author of &amp;ldquo;The Lost Order&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
