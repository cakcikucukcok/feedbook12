  <title>The Book of Dzur - Steven Brust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The first seven of Steven Brust&#39;s Vlad Taltos novels have long been in print from Ace Books in a set of three trade paperback omnibuses.  In Spring 2011, Tor put the next two Vlad books, &lt;i&gt;Dragon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Issola&lt;/i&gt;, into print as a trade paperback entitled &lt;i&gt;The Book of Dragon&lt;/i&gt;. Now we continue with the next two, collecting the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;-bestselling &lt;i&gt;Dzur&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Jhegaala&lt;/i&gt; into &lt;i&gt;The Book of Dzur&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Dzur&lt;/i&gt;, Vlad is back in the great city of Adrilankha, with a price on his head. The rackets he used to run are now under the control of the mysterious &quot;Left Hand of the Jhereg&quot;--a cabal of women who report to no man. His ex-wife needs his help. His old enemies aren&#39;t sure whether they want to kill him, or talk to him and then kill him. A goddess appears to be playing tricks with his memory. And the Great Weapon he&#39;s carrying appears to have plans of its own....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Jhegaala&lt;/i&gt;, Vlad decides to hide out among his relatives in faraway Fenario, in a papermaking town called Burz. At first it&#39;s not such a bad place, though the mill reeks to high heaven. But the longer he stays there, the stranger it becomes. Then a grisly murder takes place. And in its wake, far from Dragaera, without his usual organization working for him, Vlad has to do his sleuthing amidst an alien people...his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
