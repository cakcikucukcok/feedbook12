  <title>Once a Man the One and Only Werewolf - Blue North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I create the werewolf. It is a transformation; full blown and full out. It can be...very loveable &amp; funny. You find yourself on his side, mostly.
The male goes thru his evolution [its all very Jungian] wherein, also, he needs companionship, etc. This lead to his making friends.
Tis a witch who kicks in the turn of events - to an evolution. He finds himself in the forest, where he evolves alone, but to the soothing lullaby of howls. 
He is allowed sightings of them - wolves; he is mesmerized to delight.  One day he hears a fight that won&#39;t quit; the aftermath finds for his lonesome, the two wolves (who found themselves in trouble) to become his &#39;best friends for life&#39;. No kidding. [This is not set in cartoon motif.]
One day, a killer bear pops on the scene. The male takes the lead - only - to the dismay of his fate, the old witch spots him on that particular day in the rolling years of his evolution/exile. She is astounded at the outcome of (himself, the bear...yahta yahta) and must tell someone of her &#39;finding&#39; and the success of such an evolution [she believes is all her doing, in her blackened heart}.
She tells a professor of old money and suspicious reputation. Both are interested in the new valuable brutish property of seeming worthless intellect. This leads to the male getting captured. His capture is where his biggest evolution turns. The professor is an experimenting madman and chooses to theorize-to-execute with this capture.
Strangely, then, he is given a name [from the book, not the professor] that will stay his legend for good. Nonetheless, the male continues the years out there until his destiny finds him.
The ending - of his fate, only - brings out the moral and his evolution, in that: &#39;twas beauty in the end&#39;. But that is not the true ending, the poem is.
It is the history - of this male - who will be known in a single portrait (each) for the series, &#39;The Five Phoenix&#39;s&#39;.
Did I mention? Reincarnation, my dears.
I&#39;m alll about it!!" />
