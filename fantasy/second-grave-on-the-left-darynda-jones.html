  <title>Second Grave on the Left - Darynda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Second in the Darynda Jones&#39; award-winning paranormal series that&#39;s &quot;hilarious and heartfelt, sexy and surprising.&quot; (J.R. Ward)&lt;br&gt;When Charley Davidson and Cookie (her best friend/receptionist) have to track down a missing woman, the case is not quite as open and shut as they anticipate. A friend of Cookie&#39;s named Mimi disappeared five days earlier. This friend then sends Cookie a cryptic message telling them to meet her at a nearby coffee shop. The coffee is brewing, but Mimi&#39;s still missing. There is, however, a clue left on the bathroom wall: a woman&#39;s name, scribbled by Mimi. Mimi&#39;s husband explains that his wife had been acting strange since she found out an old friend of hers from high school had been murdered a couple weeks prior. The same woman Mimi had named in her message. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Reyes Alexander Farrow (otherwise known as the Son of Satan. Yes. Literally) has left his corporeal body and is haunting Charley. He&#39;s left his body because he&#39;s being tortured by demons who want to lure Charley closer. But Reyes can&#39;t let that happen. Because if the demons get to Charley, they&#39;ll have a portal to heaven. And if they have a portal to heaven...well, let&#39;s just say it wouldn&#39;t be pretty. Can Charley handle hot nights with Reyes and even hotter days tracking down a missing woman? Can she keep those she loves out of harm&#39;s way? And is there enough coffee and chocolate in the world to fuel her as she does?&lt;br&gt;Here is your signpost for the most hilarious read of the summer: &lt;i&gt;Second Grave On The Left&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
