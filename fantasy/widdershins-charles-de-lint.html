  <title>Widdershins - Charles de Lint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; In &lt;i&gt;Widdershins,&lt;/i&gt; fantasy author Charles de Lint has delivered one of his most accessible and moving works of his career. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jilly Coppercorn and Geordie Riddell. Since they were introduced in the first Newford story, &quot;Timeskip,&quot; back in 1989, their friends and readers alike have been waiting for them to realize what everybody else already knows: that they belong together. But they&#39;ve been more clueless about how they feel for each other than the characters in &lt;i&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/i&gt;. Now in &lt;i&gt;Widdershins&lt;/i&gt;, a stand-alone novel of fairy courts set in shopping malls and the Bohemian street scene of Newford&#39;s Crowsea area, Jilly and Geordie&#39;s story is finally being told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before it&#39;s over, we&#39;ll find ourselves plunged into the rancorous and sometimes violent conflict between the magical North American &quot;animal people&quot; and the more newly-arrived fairy folk. We&#39;ll watch as Jilly is held captive in a sinister world based on her own worst memories--and Geordie, attempting to help, is sent someplace even worse. And we&#39;ll be captivated by the power of love and determination to redeem ancient hatreds and heal old magics gone sour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To walk &quot;widdershins&quot; is to walk counterclockwise or backwards around something. It&#39;s a classic pathway into the fairy realm. It&#39;s also the way people often back slowly into the relationships that matter, the real ones that make for a life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
