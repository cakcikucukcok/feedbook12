      <meta name="description" content="One beautiful commando defends Earth&lt;BR&gt;
from its most lethal alien enemy while she&lt;BR&gt;
is surreptitiously betrayed and set-up to die.&lt;BR&gt;
When I became a wo-man, I put away&lt;BR&gt;
childish things. - I Corinthians 13:11&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
THE WILES OF VELA KURV is the&lt;BR&gt;
story about a strong, sexy, smart woman who&lt;BR&gt;
could save her world, a world not to dissimilar&lt;BR&gt;
from Earth today. Th e story starts at birth&lt;BR&gt;
and progresses to her young adulthood.&lt;BR&gt;
She develops supernatural abilities through&lt;BR&gt;
genetics and exposure to alien DNA as a&lt;BR&gt;
fetus and this causes an abandonment of love&lt;BR&gt;
from the one person she adores as a child, her&lt;BR&gt;
father. Because of her gifts Lorabella Kurv&lt;BR&gt;
Wiles must become the deliverer of mankind&lt;BR&gt;
and the keeper of the timeline. Because of&lt;BR&gt;
the life Lorabella chooses, her nemesis lies&lt;BR&gt;
in wait for revenge. As a secret agent, a girl&lt;BR&gt;
becomes a woman. She investigates how to&lt;BR&gt;
fi ght against invading aliens. During the hunt,&lt;BR&gt;
a deal is struck to kill her, but only after the&lt;BR&gt;
completion of her mission. Her maturation&lt;BR&gt;
and battle culminates into a passionate love&lt;BR&gt;
aff air with the one person she can trust, Dr.&lt;BR&gt;
Dan Gibson Val Demure. Th e story is a&lt;BR&gt;
seductive, science fi ction tale of the struggle&lt;BR&gt;
for the survival of the planet Earth.&lt;BR&gt;" />
