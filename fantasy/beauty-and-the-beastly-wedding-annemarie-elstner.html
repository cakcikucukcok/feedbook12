  <title>Beauty and the Beastly Wedding - Annemarie Elstner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The conniving yet quite stupid Queen Holandasia, her even sillier son Prince William, the intelligent and beautiful Princess Clarabella, Snootenville the royal and oh-so-sarcastic butler, and all the strange palace staff of Grottenville return in this second Grottenville book.
Prince William and Princess Clarabella are officially engaged. The palace of Grottenville is in a buzz and a flurry, what with all the wedding plans and preparations. Queen Holandasia is insistent on a Hawaiian menu, tomato red drapes, and a pineapple wedding cake! Princess Clarabella is secretly wishing that her future mother-in-law would just disappear.
To add to the buzz and flurry, Princess Clarabellas parents King Engelbert and Queen Bertha arrive at the door of Grottenville palace. Snootenville the butler is his usual sarcastic self but is secretly quite excited about the pending union, as the princess comes from a very wealthy kingdom, and this could mean great benefits to all the staff. Grottenville is still in severe economic decline, and a marriage between poor Prince William and rich Princess Clarabella will definitely fix all of that. Everyone is dreaming of new velvet drapes, soft cuddly slippers, and pots of steaming hot tea!
But what strange illness has suddenly befallen Queen Holandasia? What are the strange eerie cries echoing down the dark dismal passages of Grottenville palace? Is the upcoming wedding cursed by some strange evil lurking in the palace hallways?
Lots of surprises and snorts, hiccups and howls, and lies and laughter fill the pages of Beauty and the Beastly Wedding. Have fun with the delightful, quirky, and sometimes absolutely awful Grottenville royalty; servants; and, of course, our new arrivals, the not-so-easily convinced King Engelbert and his very trusting, loving wife Queen Bertha with her purple hair and excellent massage techniques. And like all good stories, learn a moral or two and even some brilliant handy hints! A very entertaining read for young and old alike. Enjoy!" />
