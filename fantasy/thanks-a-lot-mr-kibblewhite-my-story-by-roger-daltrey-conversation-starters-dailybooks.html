  <title>Thanks a Lot Mr Kibblewhite: My Story by Roger Daltrey | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Thanks a Lot Mr Kibblewhite: My Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; by Roger Daltrey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Who&amp;rsquo;s rise to popularity coincided with the sexual revolution. Roger Daltrey&amp;rsquo;s girlfriend got pregnant when he was 20; he married her and lived with her. But he eventually left to become a rockstar. Daltrey recounts how the band tried to make the group stand out from the countless rock groups during their time. It was having their own style that distinguished them, Daltrey thought, including wearing op art t-shirts and Carnaby Street mod clothes. It was Keith Moon however who made The Who famous. Daltrey is the voice of a generation. His generation was the first &amp;ldquo;to rebel, to step out of the shadows of the Second World War&amp;hellip;to invent the concept of the teenager.&amp;rdquo; His memoir is the story &amp;ldquo;of how the postwar generation redefined the rules of youth.&amp;rdquo; The music industry was born out of the postwar generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks A Lot, Mr. Kibblewhite is written by The Who lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, a 2008 Kennedy Center Honoree and a 1990 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
