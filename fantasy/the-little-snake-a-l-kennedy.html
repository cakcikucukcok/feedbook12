  <title>The Little Snake - A.L. Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Some time ago, perhaps before you were even born, a young girl was walking in her garden. She may have been called Mary - that&#39;s what most of the stories say. Mary was a little bit taller than the other girls her age and had brownish crinkly hair. She was quite thin, because she didn&#39;t always have exactly enough to eat. She liked honey and whistling and the colour blue and finding out.&quot;
This is the story of Mary, a young girl born in a beautiful city full of rose gardens and fluttering kites. When she is still very small, Mary meets Lanmo, a shining golden snake, who becomes her very best friend. The snake visits Mary many times, he sees her city change, become sadder as bombs drop and war creeps in. He sees Mary and her family leave their home, he sees her grow up and he sees her fall in love. But Lanmo knows that the day will come when he can no longer visit Mary, when his destiny will break them apart, and he wonders whether having a friend can possibly be worth the pain of knowing you will lose them." />
