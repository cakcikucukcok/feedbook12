  <title>George the Giant Giraffe and His Coloring Carnival - Tom Wilson, Ivan Earl Aguilar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A percentage of young children in todays world just dont how to stick to it. They want everything easy and handed to them on a silver plate. 
When it is not, they whine and step away from the activity or the learning experience, and unfortunately, most of them never come back to that situation or encounter again.
That is why other countries have surpassed us in the technology race. They are just hungrier for the learning and more persistent in the effort. They dont let failure turn them away from their effort of learning.
The theme of my story is taking a little boy who wants to give up because he thinks he is a failure. He doesnt want to try anymore because his classmates have made fun of him, and now he is full of self-doubt. Even though his mother offers encouragement and positive support, he rejects it. It is not until he encounters an extraordinary creature and his carnival does his eyes begin to open. The giraffe puts him in situation where he must try repeatedly, even when he wants to give up.
Eventually he succeeds and finds out that a wall of wont will never entrap him again; opportunities are found in plains of possibilities.
This theme is important because it illustrates that young kids can succeed when given alternative motivation. It shows how important it is to follow through on something you have started, even though you believe it doesnt look so good." />
