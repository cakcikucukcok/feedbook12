      <meta name="description" content="In another world where war is brewing between elementals and humans, Zelkova is a skilled knight who has been asked by her king to find his kidnapped son. As Zelkova and Carya-expert trackers, along with three other male companions prepare to find the missing prince, Zelkova only hopes that during their journey she can learn more about her newfound secret power. But just as she is ready to leave, she receives a strange, one-word message that leaves her more confused than ever.   As their quest begins, Zelkova must summon courage from within to confront unexpected challenges that include hatred, distrust, lies and betrayal. But when the nations ultimately break out in war, Zelkova and the others are left to wonder if their powers will help them battle what lies ahead or bring destruction to their world.   In this gripping fantasy tale, a powerful female knight embarks on a journey to find the missing prince of her land without any idea that her legend has just begun." />
