  <title>Stewards of the White Circle: Calm Before the Storm - Jt Mdiv Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All stories start somewhere...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one starts here and now, but really began an eternity ago in a forgotten place and time when a young man and a young woman made a promise to each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, an Old One desperately wants the two young people to remember their promise. He is master of the Travelers, a unique group of animals with whom he communicates mind to mind. While he has groomed the Travelers for a special destiny, he knows he will not see the task to its end. That responsibility must fall to the Shepherds &amp;ndash; the promised couple who will take on this mission and make the extraordinary sacrifice it requires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would that time were a friend, not an enemy, and these two could discover their promise in the leisure of the normal pace of life, but that is not to be. Both the Shepherds and the Travelers are fair game to a demon, commissioned by the Master of Hell, himself, to destroy the Old One and everything he loves. Beyond this, a disaster of epic proportions looms and threatens to reel the entire world into chaos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shepherds must be sealed and the Travelers led to safe haven before the world goes mad. There is so little time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Storm is coming." />
