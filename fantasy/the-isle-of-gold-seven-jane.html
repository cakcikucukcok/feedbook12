Disguised as a sailor, she joins the crew of the pirate ship &lt;em&gt;Riptide&lt;/em&gt;, helmed by the notorious Captain Erik Winters. Tenacious and rumored to be a madman, Winters is known as much for his ruthlessness as for his connection to the enigmatic and beautiful proprietress of The Goodnight Mermaid, Evangeline Dahl, who vanished from the island two summers before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At sunset the &lt;em&gt;Riptide&lt;/em&gt; sails for the mythical island of Bracile, a place hidden between air and sea and that exists only for a moment every two years&amp;mdash;and which has never returned any man who has sailed for its shores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story where history meets fantasy, &lt;em&gt;The Isle of Gold&lt;/em&gt; is an epic, emotional adventure of two women&amp;mdash;one desperate to save herself, and the other determined to be rescued&amp;mdash;and the secret which binds them together.&lt;/p&gt;" />
