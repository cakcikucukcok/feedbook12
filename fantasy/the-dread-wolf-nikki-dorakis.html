  <title>The Dread Wolf - Nikki Dorakis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Hand of Justice Series started out as one book, The Eye of Zoar  released in e-book format and paperback through Author House in July 2012 as A Rising Darkness. The original story was lost in a move and the re-writing of it resulted in plot changes that expanded the storyline  especially when the ending changed and I lost my main character. Such are the vagaries of fictional worlds I suppose.
The norm for characters in this series is bi-sexuality. The main character is, to use the language of his world slye he beds only with men. Those readers looking for salacious scenes will probably be disappointed; the sexual nature of the men and women of Zetaria is a fact of life  and even in the use of prostitutes there is respect.
The Dread Wolf picks up where A Rising Darkness ends." />
