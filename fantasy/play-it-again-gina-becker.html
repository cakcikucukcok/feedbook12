As Amy uses her past writing experience to extract an article from the supposed singer/songwriter, she takes her entire family on a spiritual journey that will change their lives forever.
Daniels gruff nature struggles against his wifes softness and willingness to accept this new young singer into their family, but in the end, even her sons ex-band mates will have to concede, theres something unique and special about Jonah.
Play It Again is a heartwarming story that will make you laugh, cry, and wonder, if you havent already, what happens to our spirit when we die?" />
