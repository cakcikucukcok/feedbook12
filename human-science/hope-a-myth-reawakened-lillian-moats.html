  <title>Hope, a Myth Reawakened - Lillian Moats</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Springing from ancient Greek mythology, HOPE, A MYTH REAWAKENED invites the reader on a journey that is both epic in scope and deeply intimate in the questions it prompts us to ask ourselves about the nature of hope in a fragile world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both a love story and a modern philosophical investigation, even the essential question of who is narrating the story draws the reader in. We take this journey on the wings of allegorical figures Hope and Despair, as we see through their eyes millennia of human love and loss, and confront today&amp;#39;s pressing and personal questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with her four previous books, Lillian Moats asks of her reader a quiet attentiveness, and amply pays back that gift. The rhythms of her writing propel us through this timely allegory, in which we meet characters wholly familiar to us, yet encounter them in ourselves as if for the first time. Full of suspense and insight, this book will speak to readers who think about a world in crisis, about the meaning of life and death, and who seek authentic hope in an age of denial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 5th book by Lillian Moats, writer, artist, and filmmaker." />
