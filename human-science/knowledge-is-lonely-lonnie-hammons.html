  <title>Knowledge Is Lonely - Lonnie Hammons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Christopher Columbus
returned to Spain after
his discovery of the New
World in 1492 he was welcomed as a
hero. The reception given to him by
Ferdinand and Isabella was everything
that he could have hoped for, and news
of the new lands to the west spread
quickly throughout Europe. In its
essence, Knowledge is Lonely, is like
that discovery so many years ago. It is
an eclectic collage of short stories, and
each one stands on their own. However
like individual instruments in an
orchestra, each story compliments the
others. The end result is a symphony
of melt in your mouth music that when
translated into words peels back the
veil of many mysteries and makes them
plain. To the reader I will not divulge
which story does this. I do not want
to deny the pleasure that can be found
in the pursuit of knowledge, but I will
assure you that it is here.
