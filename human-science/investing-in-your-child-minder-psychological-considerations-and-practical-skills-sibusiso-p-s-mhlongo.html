  <title>Investing in Your Child Minder: Psychological Considerations and Practical Skills - Sibusiso P.S. Mhlongo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Childminding is one responsibility which is generally taken lightly. Child minders are often employed in a causal manner and there is often no synchronisation between the parenting style constantly used by the child minder and that adopted by the childs biological parent/s. Conscious investment is often not made on the emotional wellbeing of child minders. This book arms the reader with the knowledge and skills of recruiting, selecting, orientating, training, compensating, motivating and appraising the performance of child minders. The reader is further exposed to parenting needs for children of different developmental stages. The importance of investing on the emotional wellbeing of the child minder cannot be overstated. The reader is empowered with knowledge and skills of effectively making this investment. This book is a must-read for all parents who want to protect their children from the lasting negative psychological effects which may unwittingly or deliberately be caused by child minders who are given too much responsibility with little boundaries and guidance." />
