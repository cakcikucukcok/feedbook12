  <title>Slow Down, I’M Getting Well Too Fast - Dr. Iren Fellegvari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our eyes are involved in most of our experiences and in forming our memories. It seems logical that we can use our eyes to change hurtful memories. Emotional Transformation Therapy (ETT) was developed with this concept in mind.&lt;p&gt;
Emotions play an extraordinary role in our lives. Every event is labeled with a corresponding emotion in our brains. An experience can be characterized as pleasant or dangerousor by any other identifier that influences our thoughts and actions or determines whether we want to remember a particular occurrence.&lt;p&gt;
Events do not change if the emotional labels are altered, but we think and react differently to different labels. People can go from feeling victimized to becoming proud survivors if the labels are changed. A crisis situation can become either a tragedy or a new beginning based on a persons emotional evaluation.&lt;p&gt;
ETT does not change facts, but it can help transform shame, fear, loneliness, emptiness, and other often paralyzing feelings, opening up a person to the possibility of more realistic and empowering mind-sets. ETT offers quick, goal-oriented treatment for severe psychological problems like PTSD, abuse, and eating disorders and everyday situations such as stress in ones professional life, anxiety that hinders achievement, and more. Learn more about this revolutionary new treatment method designed by a licensed clinical psychologist, and unlock the secret to fast, effective recovery." />
