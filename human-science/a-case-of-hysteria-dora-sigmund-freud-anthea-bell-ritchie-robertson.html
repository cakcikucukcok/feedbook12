  <title>A Case of Hysteria: (Dora) - Sigmund Freud, Anthea Bell, Ritchie Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;I very soon had an opportunity to interpret Dora&#39;s nervous coughing as the outcome of a fantasized sexual situation.&#39;
A Case of Hysteria, popularly known as the Dora Case, affords a rare insight into how Freud dealt with patients and interpreted what they told him.  The 18-year-old &#39;Dora&#39; was sent for psychoanalysis by her father after threatening suicide; as Freud&#39;s enquiries deepened, he uncovered a remarkably unhappy and conflict-ridden family, with several competing versions of their story. The narrative became a crucial text in the evolution of his theories, combining his studies on hysteria and
his new theory of dream-interpretation with early insights into the development of sexuality. The unwitting preconceptions and prejudices with which Freud approached his patient reveal his blindness and the broader attitudes of turn-of-the-century Viennese society, while his account of &#39;Dora&#39;s&#39; emotional
travails is as gripping as a modern novel.
This new translation is accompanied by a substantial introduction which sets the work in its biographical, historical, and intellectual context, and offers a close and critical analysis of the text itself.
