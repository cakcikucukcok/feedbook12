  <title>Name Your Story - Lauren Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young adults feel a lot of pressure these days. Get into the best college, win the soccer tournament, and land the dream internship if you want to be worthy. Sound familiar? With all this stress, its no wonder that students are saying they feel depressed, anxious, or overwhelmed at an alarmingly high rate. What is especially worrisome is that many of these students are too afraid to seek help. Clearly its time for a change.
Lauren Cook provides an intentional space where young adults can learn about mental health in a safe way. Heres what you can expect:
An overview of signs/symptoms of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, and other conditions.
How to get help if you feel stressed, scared, or unwell.
How to talk with friends, family members, and partners if youre concerned about them and their wellbeing.
What to do if you or someone you know is feeling suicidal.
Resources to guide you to further information and support.
Lauren also emphasizes the need for self-care. We need to put on our own oxygen mask first before we can help others. By focusing on gratitude, optimism, mindfulness, and remembering how to play, Lauren reminds us how to prioritize our own well-being from a proactive stance." />
