  <title>Developing Dynamic Intersections between Collection Development and Information Literacy Instruction - Amanda Scull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;Developing Dynamic Intersections between Collection Development and Information Literacy Instruction &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;identifies the intersections between collection development and information literacy instruction and provides a practical guide for improving communication and collaboration between these two areas of the library. The early chapters explore general issues that are widely applicable across academic libraries, including a reading of the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education through the lens of collection development and discussions of communication and acquisitions budgeting. The later chapters examine undergraduate research and open access initiatives as specific opportunities for collaborative work, culminating in a chapter on special collections and archives that presents exemplary initiatives from this specialized area that can be adapted to the general library. Drawing upon original research and interviews, as well as professional experience and a large body of literature, this book provides a foundation for instruction librarians and collection librarians to begin exploring the intersections of their work as well as practical suggestions and ideas for building upon that foundation through implementation. Collection librarians, instruction librarians, library administrators, and professional staff who work in these areas will benefit from this book. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
