  <title>Individuality and Beyond - Benedetta Zavatta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though few might think to connect the two figures, Ralph Waldo Emerson was an important influence on Friedrich Nietzsche. Specifically, Emerson played a fundamental role in shaping Nietzsche&#39;s philosophical ideas on individualism, perfectionism, and the pursuit of virtue, as well as his critiques of social conditioning, religious dogmatism, and anti-natural morality. With &lt;em&gt;Individuality and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, Benedetta Zavatta offers the first philosophical interpretation of Emerson&#39;s influence on Nietzsche based on a sound philological analysis of previously unpublished materials from Nietzsche&#39;s private library. Nietzsche&#39;s collection reveals numerous copies of Emerson&#39;s essays covered with annotations and marginalia as Nietzsche revisited these works throughout his life.
Through close-reading, Zavatta casts a new light on the ways in which Emerson&#39;s work informed Nietzsche&#39;s defining ideas of self-creation, the relation between fate and free will, overcoming morality of customs and achieving moral autonomy, and the &quot;transvaluation&quot; of such values as compassion and altruism. Zavatta organizes these concepts into two main lines of thought: the first concerns the development of the individual personality, or the achievement of intellectual and moral autonomy and original self-expression. The second, on the contrary, concerns the overcoming of individuality and the need to transcend a limited view of the world by continually questioning one&#39;s own values and engaging with opposing perspectives.
Ultimately, Zavatta clarifies the surprising contributions that Emerson made to 20th century European philosophy. She provides a fresh portrait of Emerson as an American thinker long stereotyped as a na&amp;#239;ve idealist disinterested in the social issues of his day. Seen through the eyes of Nietzsche, his acute interpreter, Emerson becomes an incisive cultural critic, whose contributions underpin contemporary philosophy." />
