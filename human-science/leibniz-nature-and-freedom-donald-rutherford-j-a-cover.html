  <title>Leibniz: Nature and Freedom - Donald Rutherford, J. A. Cover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The revival of Leibniz studies in the past twenty-five years has cast important new light on both the context and content of Leibnizs philosophical thought. Where earlier English-language scholarship understood Leibnizs philosophy as issuing from his preoccupations with logic and language, recent work has recommended an account on which theological, ethical, and metaphysical themes figure centrally in Leibnizs thought throughout his career. The significance of these themes to the development of Leibnizs philosophy is the subject of increasing attention by philosophers and historians.    This collection of new essays by a distinguished group of scholars offers an up-to-date overview of the current state of Leibniz research. In focusing on nature and freedom, the volume revisits two key topics in Leibnizs thought, on which he engaged both contemporary and historical arguments. Important contributions to Leibniz scholarship in their own right, these articles collectively provide readers a framework in which to better situate Leibnizs distinctive philosophy of nature and the congenial home for a morally significant freedom that he took it to provide." />
