  <title>A Conversaunt Existence - G. Bradley Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discussions about existence have generally come through the subject of philosophy. The thinking and thoughts about God&#39;s existence are well documented. Both sides of the standard arguments for God&#39;s existence have been presented. Current thinking has turned to evolutionary concepts that deny God exists or claims that God is a mere impersonal force. However, the time has come for a fresh look into how man can know of God&#39;s existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Conversaunt Existence is just such a look. Changes have been made to the standard arguments for God&#39;s existence. New avenues of thought have been incorporated to corroborate these changes. There are reasons for directing our thoughts toward God&#39;s existing: First, it&#39;s foolish to let others steer one&#39;s thinking into denying God&#39;s existence. Ultimately, God wants everyone to respond to His invitation, accept His lifesaving and life-giving message, and participate in writing His story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;KIRKUS REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;A short treatise on existence with an emphasis on the existence of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nelson harkens back to a premodern era by using the archaic word &quot;conversaunt&quot; in place of &quot;conversant&quot; in his title. In doing so, he honors the fact that humankind has always experienced existence as a common form of knowledge. Nelson&#39;s work, though deeply philosophical in content, is meant from the beginning to have a personal impact on the reader and not just be merely theoretical in nature. Moreover, his overarching goal is to demonstrate the existence of a personal and involved God. Such authors as C.S. Lewis and Soren Kierkegaard help lead the way. In order to show that the human race is capable of understanding and even connecting with a God figure, Nelson coins a new term intercomplexicate which describes a self-consciousness that is able to make quick evaluations of complex ideas, leading to moral understanding. The author discusses both the strengths and weaknesses of ontological arguments for God&#39;s existence and also attempts to disprove popular scientific arguments against the existence of a deity. The idea of contingency (that existence can only occur due to a prior cause) is of great importance in later chapters, as Nelson argues that existence must be contingent on a &quot;necessary being,&quot; such as a primary mover or first cause. In closing, the author provides a case not merely for a creator (&quot;watchmaker&quot;) God, but for a personal God who continues to be involved with creation. Nelson has a penchant for mixing theoretical and philosophical verbiage with nonstandard language (such as using &quot;by da vey&quot; instead of &quot;by the way&quot; or comparing God with Jean-Luc Picard of Star Trek: The Next Generation). He seems to be seeking a balance between the often opaque material he presents and the personal effect he hopes to have on readers. This balance, unfortunately, is rarely found. Nevertheless, Nelson provides sound arguments worthy of further reflection. Review questions after each chapter are helpful for guiding and focusing the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A thoughtful, refreshing argument for God&#39;s existence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
