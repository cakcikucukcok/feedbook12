  <title>From Coach to Awakener - Robert Brian Dilts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coaching&lt;/em&gt; is the process of helping people and teams to perform at the peak of their abilities. It involves drawing out people&amp;rsquo;s strengths, helping them to bypass personal barriers and limits in order to achieve their personal bests, and facilitating them to function more effectively as members of a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, coaching has been focused toward achieving improvement with respect to a specific behavioral performance. This involves promoting the development of that person&amp;rsquo;s behavioral competence through careful observation and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the notion of coaching has taken on a more generalized and expanded meaning. Personal coaching, executive coaching and life coaching provide support on a number of different levels: behaviors, capabilities, beliefs, values, identity and even spiritual. These new and more comprehensive forms&amp;mdash;executive coaching and life coaching&amp;mdash; can be referred to as capital &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; Coaching. Large &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; Coaching involves helping people effectively achieve outcomes on a range of levels. We &lt;em&gt;guide&lt;/em&gt; people to learn about new environments, for instance; &lt;em&gt;coach&lt;/em&gt; them to improve specific behavioral competencies; &lt;em&gt;teach&lt;/em&gt; them new cognitive capabilities; &lt;em&gt;mentor&lt;/em&gt; empowering beliefs and values; &lt;em&gt;sponsor&lt;/em&gt; growth at the identity level; and &lt;em&gt;awaken&lt;/em&gt; people&amp;rsquo;s awareness of the larger system or &amp;ldquo;field.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book defines the types of contexts and situations which require the capital &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; Coach to focus on one of these roles&amp;mdash;caretaker, guide, coach, teacher, mentor, sponsor, awakener&amp;mdash;and provides a specific toolbox for each role. In other words, it provides a comprehensive tool set to be used by an effective coach to manage the entire scope of large &amp;quot;C&amp;quot; Coaching activities&amp;mdash;from caretaking to awakening.&lt;/p&gt;" />
