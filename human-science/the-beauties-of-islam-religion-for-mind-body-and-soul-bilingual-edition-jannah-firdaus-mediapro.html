  <title>The Beauties of Islam Religion For Mind, Body and Soul Bilingual Edition - Jannah Firdaus Mediapro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Beauties of Islam Religion For Mind, Body and Soul Bilingual Edition In English and Spanish Languange Based From The Noble Quran and Al-Hadith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this time in Islam&amp;rsquo;s history, when the entire religion is being judged by the actions of a few, it is appropriate to step back from the glare of the media spotlight and examine the beauties that infuse the way of life known as Islam. There is greatness and splendour in Islam that is often overshadowed by actions that have no place in Islam or by people who speak about topics they only vaguely understand. Islam is a religion, a way of life that inspires Muslims to try harder, reach farther and act in a manner that is pleasing to those around them and most importantly pleasing to their Creator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The beauties of Islam are those things that are part of the religion and make Islam stand out. Islam answers all of humankind&amp;rsquo;s eternal questions. Where did I come from? Why am I here? Is this really all there is? It answers these question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Holy Quran is a book detailing the glory of God and the wonder of His creation; it is also a testament to His Mercy and Justice. It is not a history book, a storybook, or a scientific textbook, although it does contain all of those genres and more. The Quran is God&amp;rsquo;s greatest gift to humanity &amp;ndash; it is a book like no other, for it contains the answers to the mysteries of life. It answers the questions and asks us to look beyond materialism and see that this life is little more than a transient stop on the way to everlasting life. Islam gives a clear aim and purpose to life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
