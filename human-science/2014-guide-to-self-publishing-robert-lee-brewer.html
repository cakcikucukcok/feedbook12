  <title>2014 Guide to Self-Publishing - Robert Lee Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;2014 Guide to Self-Publishing&lt;/i&gt; is our first new market book since 2007 (&lt;i&gt;2008 Screenwriter&#39;s Market&lt;/i&gt;). The biggest problem with creating books for authors interested in self-publishing is that most books on the topic are so far out of date after a year that they&#39;re no longer of much use. The market book model is perfect for the topic of self-publishing since its annual publication schedule allows us to make important updates in a timely fashion. Not only does the book show you how to publish on your own in the most efficient, cost-effective way possible (including digital-only publishing), but you&#39;ll also get insights into creating your own marketing plans and learning how other authors have found success. You&#39;ll learn about the different services available, as well as gain access to thousands of listings that detail freelance editors and designers, as well as production facilities that can help you produce your book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
