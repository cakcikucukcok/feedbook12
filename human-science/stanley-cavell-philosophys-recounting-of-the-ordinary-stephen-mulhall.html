This book elucidates the essentially philosophical roots and trajectory of Cavells work, traces its links with Romanticism and its recent turn towards a species of moralpefectionism associated with Thoreau and Emerson, and concludes with an assessment of its relations to liberal-democratic political theory, Christian religious thought, and feminist literary studies. It will be of interest to anyone concerned with the relationships between Anglo-American and Continental philosophy, and between philosophy and other disciplines in the humanities. an excellent presentation and discussion of [Cavells] thought . . . very timely Political Studies Learning to read Mulhall is both a suitable and a worthy first step to learning to read Cavell  British Journal of Aesthetics there can be no doubt as to the depth of Mulhalls knowledge of Cavells writings or to his ability as an advocate.
