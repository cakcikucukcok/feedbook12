  <title>Family or Foe - Jewel Garrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Personality disorder is rife in Ghana. As an experienced mental health practitioner, I have had the opportunity to observe the behaviours of many people, and this has led me to suspect that many of them may be suffering from some form of a personality disorder; however, in the absence of any formal knowledge about mental illness, the Ghanaian public appears totally oblivious to this fact. This, coupled with the stigma of mental illness, results in denial. 
This book, inspired by the lack of acknowledgement and or recognition of mental illness by the citizens of Ghana gives insight into and highlights the issues involved in this subject area with regards to a person suffering from what would appear to be a personality disorder.
It demonstrates how easy it is to apply theory to practice; it takes the reader through a step-by-step critical review of the literature and theories associated with personality and personality disorder to arrive at a diagnosis of an individual with psychopathology. It demonstrates the application of the literature in investigations and assessments in mental health and is a must read for anyone in the fields of medicine, psychology, and mental health nursing, particularly students, lecturers and teachers. 
The critical analysis, review of the literature, and the demonstration of the correlation between theories, the literature, and relevant individual information and assessment to achieve the desired results of diagnosing the disorder are expertly, competently, and proficiently executed to highlight the ease with which anyone can do so, particularly learners. 
For the layperson, this book gives insight into our day-to-day challenges of living with an individual suffering from a mental disorder; specifically, severe personality disorder of the psychopathic and sociopathic types." />
