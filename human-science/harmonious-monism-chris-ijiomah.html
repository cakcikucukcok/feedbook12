  <title>Harmonious Monism - Chris Ijiomah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a reaction against young Levy Bruhl&#39;s position that the world&#39;s (African)  thought is pre- logical. Systematically therefore it exposes first the influence of positivism and two valued Logic on Bruhl which made him to be anti- spiritualism and second interpreted African thought from two- valued logic point of view. This wrong interpretational tool resulted to his  &#39;&#39;onslaught on African thought&#39;&#39; which is the subject of the book&#39;s reaction. This book &#39;s position is that every interpretation stems from a particular logic and this logic needs to evolve from the same ontological context with the phenomenon that is to be interpreted. 
The implication of this is that, there is a bio conditional structural relationship between  every logic and  its cultural ontology. The book investigates this assertion  using prevalent (2vl) of the West and the prevalent ontology of the the same culture. The investigation  proved positive. On the above discovery the book developed the theory of  structural analogy  and logical functionalism (SAALF) as a justification for the derivation of  a prevalent  trinitarian logic from African trinitarian prevalent ontology. From this theoretical standpoint, the book in agreement with some twentieth century analytic logicians defines logic as a science of relation between realities from which principles of argumentation  and reasoning can be developed. This book goes ahead to use this logic to explain some African phenomena such as the concept of African healing oath-taking and education. For the benefit of doubt the book differentiates between Harmonious monism and Hermeneutics as an answer to some questions of the critics." />
