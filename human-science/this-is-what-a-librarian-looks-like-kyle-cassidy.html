  <title>This Is What a Librarian Looks Like - Kyle Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2014, author and photographer Kyle Cassidy published a photo essay on Slate.com called &quot;This is What A Librarian Looks Like,&quot; a montage of portraits and a tribute to librarians. Since then, Cassidy has made it his mission to remind us of how essential librarians and libraries are to our communities. His subjects are men and women of all ages, backgrounds, and personal style-from pink hair and leather jackets to button-downs and blazers. In short, not &lt;i&gt;necessarily&lt;/i&gt; what one thinks a librarian looks like. The nearly 220 librarians photographed also share their personal thoughts on what it means to be a librarian. &lt;i&gt;This is What A Librarian Looks Like &lt;/i&gt;also includes original essay by some of our most beloved writers, journalists, and commentators including Neil Gaiman, George R.R. Martin, Nancy Pearl, Cory Doctorow, Paula Poundstone, Amanda Palmer, Peter Sagal, Jeff VanderMeer, John Scalzi, Sara Farizan, Amy Dickinson, and others. Cassidy also profiles a handful of especially influential librarians and libraries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
