  <title>If the Bible Is as Much Fable as Fact, Did God Create Man or Did Man Create God? - Peter Seiler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If the Bible is as Much Fable as Fact, Did God Create Man or Did Man Create God? searches for a reasonable and reasoned foundation upon which to speak of the relationship between God and humanity. The author, Peter Seiler, marshals his education in both science and history in his exploration of the Bibles claims of faith, shedding the light of scientific findings and historical analysis on the biblical texts.
Spanning ten parts, the text begins with an extended introduction to the author and his method before conducting a four-part examination of the history of faith from the ancient past through the Enlightenment. Then the author examines, in three parts, the case for the involvement of alien life in human history. Finally, he turns to the future before summarizing his conclusions.
If the Bible is as Much Fable as Fact, Did God Create Man or Did Man Create God? will satisfy the hunger of readers who desire to shed the light of reason, bolstered by verifiable facts, upon the claims of faith. It also will intrigue people with deeply held beliefs who desire to know the yearnings of their friends and family members who find those same claims of faith on the far side of a chasm they cannot traverse by a leap of faith. In either case, If the Bible is as Much Fable as Fact, Did God Create Man or Did Man Create God? makes a powerful case for its perspective on the titles question." />
