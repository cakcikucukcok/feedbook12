  <title>The Fascinated Observer - Kristy Sweetland, Nina Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;DIVINITY IS INSIDE OF US.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book rests upon the profound richness of a&amp;nbsp;non-dogmatic philosophical and spiritual foundation. A labor of true love, this is a guide for declaring our sovereignty, and learning to accept complete responsibility for our lives. Using the simple S.T.A.R. formula of Surrender, Trust, Allow, Receive, as well as the Four Essential Qualities of Wholeness (human divinity), Self-love, Play (the now moment) and the Embodiment of the Expanded Golden Rule, the concepts support us in finding a life of total empowerment. Written from the enlightening&amp;nbsp;perspective of philosopher Nina Brown, articulated by Kristy Sweetland, M.A., Master of Transpersonal Psychology, it is a blueprint to spiritual freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two enlivened&amp;nbsp;authors&amp;nbsp;have provided practical and inspirational insights on putting the S.T.A.R. philosophy to use to help us with some of the toughest human experiences. While reading this book, we are invited to make quantum leaps into the octaves of richness, amazing relationships,&amp;nbsp;creativity, play and more. Once we start to weave&amp;nbsp;this formula into our world,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Fascinated Observer&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;takes new life within us, liberating us&amp;nbsp;from even the most tenacious patterns of stagnancy and complacency, giving us the fuel to move forward, powered by our heart, spirit and highest consciousness.&amp;nbsp;From that place we can stop reacting our way through life, and begin to feel and sense our way more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;S.T.A.R. was gifted by the archangels to build creativity, increase intuition, deeply pacify and revitalize humanity, reminding us that we are sovereign creator beings. This book will encourage growth in ways never considered before. It&amp;rsquo;s not simply about transforming our life, it&amp;rsquo;s about transforming our world, inner and outer, and accepting that we&amp;nbsp;have the power to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From spiritual depth&amp;nbsp;to rich practical insights and powerfully enlightening activities that engage, nurture and challenge; this guide has been written to lead readers into the beautiful octaves of inner human divinity that come from the simple yet profound act of becoming a Fascinated Observer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
