  <title>My Thoughts - Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron of La Brède and of Montesquieu, Henry C. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; provides a unique window into the mind of one of the undisputed pioneers of modern thought, the author of &lt;I&gt;The Spirit of the Laws&lt;/I&gt;. From the publication of his first masterpiece, &lt;I&gt;Persian Letters&lt;/I&gt;,  in 1721, until his death in 1755, Montesquieu maintained notebooks in  which he wrote and dictated ideas on a wide variety of topics. Some of  the contents are early drafts of passages that Montesquieu eventually  placed in his published works; others are outlines or early versions of  projected works that were ultimately lost, unfinished, or abandoned.  These notebooks provide important insights into his views on a broad  range of topics, including morality, religion, history, law, economics,  finance, science, art, and constitutional liberty.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Montesquieu called these notebooks, &lt;I&gt;Mes Pens&amp;egrave;es (My Thoughts),&lt;/I&gt; and they appear in their entirety in English for the first time in this Liberty Fund edition.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Editor and translator Henry C. Clark provides readers with translations  of most of the footnotes contained in the 1991 French edition by Louis  Desgraves, while adding new notes and other aids to understanding the  text and translation. These features provide the frame for a revealing  portrait of one of the most influential figures of the eighteenth  century.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Henry C. Clark&lt;/B&gt; is Visiting Professor in the Clemson  Institute for the Study of Capitalism at Clemson University. He has  published two books and several articles, many on the French and  Scottish Enlightenments.&lt;/div&gt;" />
