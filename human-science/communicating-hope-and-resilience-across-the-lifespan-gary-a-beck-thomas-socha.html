  <title>Communicating Hope and Resilience Across the Lifespan - Gary A. Beck, Thomas Socha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From serious illness to natural disasters, humans turn to communication as a major source of strength to help us bounce back and to keep growing and thriving.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Communicating Hope and Resilience Across the Lifespan&lt;/I&gt; addresses the various ways in which communication plays an important role in fostering hope and resilience. Adopting a lifespan approach and offering a new framework to expand our understanding of the concepts of «hope» and «resilience» from a communication perspective, contributors highlight the variety of «stressors» that people may encounter in their lives. They examine connections between the cognitive dimensions of hope such as self-worth, self-efficacy, and creative problem solving. They look at the variety of messages that can facilitate or inhibit experiencing hope in relationships, groups, and organizations. Other contributors look at how communication that can build strengths, enhance preparation, and model successful adaptation to change has the potential to lessen the negative impact of stress, demonstrating resilience.&lt;BR&gt; As an important counterpoint to recent work focusing on what goes wrong in interpersonal relationships, communication that has the potential to uplift and facilitate responses to stressful circumstances is emphasized throughout this volume. By offering a detailed examination of how to communicate hope and resilience, this book presents practical lessons for individuals, marriages, families, relationship experts, as well as a variety of other practitioners." />
